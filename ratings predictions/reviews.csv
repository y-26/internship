449,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - ..."

485,5,Perfect product!,"This is my first Mini, coming from an XR and 7plus, I was a bit apprehensive of going for a small screen, however once I got the phone I knew I had made the right decision.Purely from an usable form factor, getting used to the small screen, took me all of 60bseconds.I use my phone primarily for office stuff, and this fits the bill.It's compact, can be used by one hand easily, slipsnin your pocket, without odd bulges and hence is extremely comfortable during traveling or even riding a bi..."
486,4,Good choice,Some apps for online sellers like that of FlipKart and UniCommerce not too compatible with IOS. Secondly not a single whatsapp chats from Android was transferred to this phone. The built quality of this phone is fine but it‚Äôs too slippery to be used without a case.
487,5,Perfect product!,"It's been 2 months now since I purchased my first iphone. Earlier I was really worried about the size and battery but after using it I have realised that it is worth it. Display, camera, operating system and speakers are always awesome on iPhone. Also, the size is small but that is fine for normal use. Even its battery is more than what I was expecting.

489,5,Classy product,Wonderful iPhone I exchanged with iPhone se 1st gen. it‚Äôs a great jump I got this at 33k in bbd thank you Flipkart. It can last up to next 4-5years without any issues and lots of updates. Great support from apple. After using of two months I feel battery is last up to 6 hrs of screen on time.
490,5,Highly recommended,Really a good Phone!! Not because it‚Äôs an iPhone!! It‚Äôs compact‚Ä¶1 hand useable.. and more over was able to get it for 37k in big billion day..iOS is clean and no ads!! Jumping from Mi to iPhone did made a difference!!But at the end of the day it‚Äôs a phone.. that‚Äôs it!!Rear camera is beast!! But front cam still has its way to come!!
491,5,Fabulous!,"There was a delay on account of rescheduling from my side. But Flipkart had been exemplary in resolving the issue with courier partners and delivering it finally. So cheers to Flipkart and its customer care executives. It‚Äôs an awesome phone in small form factor if that excites you with outstanding display, camera and performance and one handed usage. Wish the battery had little more juice to last through the day. If u can spend 8 to 10 k extra go and grab it‚Äôs bigger sibling iPhone 12."

493,5,Excellent,Thanx Flipkart for solving my issue. Got the beast in 37k on day of sale. Performance booster ideal for people with small hands and liking for small phones. Android is nowhere to is except customizations. Battery is adequate however for gamers need a good PowerBank for fast charging.Got in exchange for Buyback Value for Mi10T
494,5,Just wow!,"I‚Äôve never had an iPhone or anything apple and at 22 years old I decided to make the switch from android. I got the mini because I feel like it‚Äôs perfect for my needs as far as size and how iOS 15.0.2 is so user friendly,fast and customizable. Screen is very crisp and bright, colors vivid. Android got pretty stale for me but I never did have any of the more expensive Samsung or pixel phones, just the basic boring run of mill ones. So this was a successful transition for me and I felt like I w..."
495,5,Brilliant,"It has been nearly 25 days now after I bought iPhone 12 mini and so far the phone performs just like it should! Super fast and super crisp display. Only rouse would be battery which lasts 24 hours on regular use of social media, videos, camera and browsing. So minus point there but this is iPhone 12 mini with smaller size with same performance of iPhone 12. So compromise on the battery was obvious.

The camera is not super great, the other phone one plus nord 2 is doing better than this in terms of camera and power back up time.

514,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Value for money proposition from AppleFirst time buyers, plss do buy an Apple compatible adaptor (you can go for original at around 1800 or can go for alternatives like portronics , at affordable price.For headphone wired connection, you need to buy a convertor which is readily available.Nice quality camera. Good battery backup."

516,5,Super!,"Awesome camera, far better performance on 4K video editing than even my laptop with dedicated GPU. True tone display is a blessing. Screen gets plenty bright outdoors. Phone feels just right in the hand, very easy to type with one hand.Battery life could use some work, even with my light use it just lasts a day, so those with heavy use might need to charge this twice or thrice a day. But a smaller battery charges faster so there is that.Overall, it was a very good deal for what I paid."
517,5,Brilliant,Perfect size. Perfect performance. Havent seen a better camera on a smart phone before. Got it for an awesome 42k. Only thing it lags in is battery. But then if you are like me and you dont travel around much its not a great deal. Screen and performance in general is spotless. Get it definitely if your sick of bulky phones.

I am a bit disappointed with the battery and hoped it wasn't that bad.

Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone.

My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good.

1314,5,Excellent,To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great.

1317,4,Good quality product,"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3."

1753,4,Wonderful,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time. Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.

Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I‚Äôll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece."
1758,4,Very Good,"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good.The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery.

Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn‚Äôt care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours.

1764,4,Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.There's a few things it could've done better:1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ..."

1767,1,Unsatisfactory,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery.Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins.Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins.Which seems to be bit faster consumption.

Awesome Camera, amazing Performance thanks to A13 Bionic.Suggestion go for 128GB it will help you in long run. Overall a very good and nice product."

1773,5,Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with..."
1774,5,Terrific,"This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable.

I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part.

1792,5,Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace.

1793,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don‚Äôt like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

1821,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily.

1829,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price.

Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.There's a few things it could've done better:1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ..."

My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3."

2192,5,Fabulous!,Nice mobile by realme .. but miss vooc fast charging and could have given more megapixel camera for main camera ... Atleast 64 mp.. even narzo series have fast charging.. realme 8 5g series should have been given with vooc fast charging.. one thing I loved about is supports external card as well upto 1tb.. also Android 11 is bonus... But also some unwanted apps should be removed as it might reduce performance for our needs.. hopefully to get updates in future to cut off those apps..

2612,5,Terrific,I am rating this Laptop as 5 because of the power full system and configurations it holds.Positive points :1. It is NOT MADE IN CHINA.2. Pure feeling of having SSD as it starts in 3 to 5 seconds also awakes in the similar timeframe.3. The Video Quality is good so it clears that the Graphic Memory is awesome.4. Key Pad is very colorful makes it attractive although it has nothing to do with performance.5. Software execution time in in fraction of seconds so the 16 GB feel is good.6. Ryz...
2613,5,I Love it,"This is a very powerful machine it can be used for gaming, as well as it can be used to run 3D Modeling or CAD/CAM software, video editing software, hardware such as RAM, SSD can be upgraded in the future if required. it is light in weight, I am happy with it. It has very premium luck, Thank Flipkart. Thank you, HP."
2614,5,Great product,"This laptop is worth the money, the best 3060 laptop you can possibly buy it can do everythingYou can use this is as a gaming device and also productivity deviceThe battery backup was good enough to last your work"
2615,5,Terrific,what a product it looks way more better in real than in the pictures.also performance is top notchand the price was just great. i got it for only 1.12 lakhwhich provide the most performance to pricei just love love itif u are thinking for this just go ahead without any second thoughts
2616,5,Fabulous!,Probably the best laptop in this price bracket in 2021. Minimalistic design with enough posas to appeal to all kinds of people. The power under the chassis is crazy and the feel of the hardware is great. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking at buying a gaming system this year.
2617,4,Good choice,For 1 lakh it was a stellar deal. Great performance great screen. And battery life is similar to all gaming laptops. The build of the laptop is premium but I feel the hinge area might be a little delicate as it has less support in the back area. Otherwise nothing to complain. .This laptop is for those too who don't want a very tacky laptop which has rgb lights all over and things like that. This seems a very professional laptops. For the weight is well distributed it does not feel heavy at al...
2618,5,Excellent,"I got this laptop at 1.02 lakhs. I loved it. Its performance and aesthetics, all are superb.Only cons1. Battery : it is not much efficient, draining quite fast i f you running the fan at high speed and doing tasks.2. Hinge - Its not super sturdy. In case of a light movement, the screen will wobble a bit. But if your task is more on stable surface, its good to go.Apart from it, i would say everything is fantastic. Go for it."
2619,5,Just wow!,one of the best budget option for both content creation and gaming. Best rtx 3060 laptop for this price. Excellent price to performance ratio with excellent build quality. Highly recommended.
2620,5,Excellent,An amazing laptop for the price. Intel CPUs in 2021 are dead and AMD is actually taking over. The 5800h performs extremely smooth. Having 6gb graphics is also phenomenal especially when it's nvidia. Display is really good with the 144hzs but only downside is that it doesn't get as bright.Now the specifics.Battery life is good. It's display is 144hz so don't expect a day's worth but if you really want maximum u can reduce the refresh rate to 60 in the settings and get an extra hour or tw...
2621,3,Nice,"Good laptop but too expensive better to buy lenovo legion 5 as it has better specs for the same price. and the battery is very bad it doesn't last very long if you are using programmes like sketchup and lumion, it lasts for 2-3 hrs if you are using these programmes which is pretty disappointing, it runs windows 11 smoothly though but 1.29 lakh price is too expensive for this laptop"
2622,1,Utterly Disappointed,"Received different product and Flipkart is not properly responding about this took 2 weeks still not providing replacement, I have told them that I can even provide unboxing video as well."
2623,5,Wonderful,It's Amazing !!! & So Smooth.
2624,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Arrived 1 day before expected delivery and as always had a doubt about expensive online purchases but the model I received had no issues, works excellent and performs upto the mark. No problems seen in hardware and battery lasts quite a long time. All in all worth your money!"
2625,5,Must buy!,Good thermals but display panel is made of poor plastic material ...charger gets very hot while normal usage too other than that overall good product

Viewing angles are better than most of the competition but the colors look cartoonistic and is not accurate, human skin subjects look paintish and over saturated.

3364,4,Nice product,"It's good, specially best for students. But the battery backup and camera quality is not so good. And not for gaming like gta 5, bgmi, free fire. If you are a professional gamer then see other laptop."
3365,3,Does the job,"Writing review after thoroughly usage:1.Best part is SSD, boot time and performance are quick due to inbuilt SSD.2. Fingerprint scanner is too fast to unlock.3. It is lite weight & Design is good inspite of 15.6inch display.4. Battery backup is 5-6 hours of continuous use.Worst things in this model that can not be ignored are;1. Camera is useless, not good for regular use.2. This model promises UHD display but this is not perfect UHD.3. Speaker is not impressive and having lower vo..."
3366,5,Best for productive works(Except Camera),"Except camera everything is very good, still 5 star because in this price range for me this is the best laptop.It has 2 slots for memory so it is upgradable in future and one more thing in the product description nothing is specified about the battery life, but battery life is also very good.Any one who is looking for productive work can go for it easily (Just keep one thing in mind that camera quality is not good)"

3369,5,Great product,"The Laptop looks nice and even works amazing due to SSD which provides a great speed while working and even starts in few seconds which is remarkable. Best Budget Laptop which is amazing in everything like Battery backup, Performance, Touchpad mouse, its Finger print sensor and truly its Thin & Light laptop except the camera quality which can be manageable at these price. Must buy during the Sale period as it will cost you only 32K-33K instead of 38K-40K during normal period."
3370,5,Wonderful,1. Unmatchable performance boot will take hardly 5 seconds thats incredible!2. Battery is okay okay 6hrs3. Keyboard is nice but no backlit slightly disappointed4. Fingerprint reader is not bad sometimes i gotta press 2 to 3 times to unlock5. Built quality is not so bad and not good also but better than most of the laptops in this range6. No LAN port7. RAM management is not good i would like to say one shld upgrade but u can manage also not a problem imoas there is optane memory...

3547,4,Value-for-money,"Good Purchase, here are some issues I faced though :1. Screen Bleeding2. Screen switches off and on when connecting to chargerOther than these issues I agree with the positive reviews from others."
3548,5,Highly recommended but wait for upcoming mi laptop,"I am civil engineer and i installed SketchUp and latest autocad which is i using since 1 week and it running smoothly , Battery was definitely Better than Dell and HP ..it give you min 5 hours by medium usage, only backlight keyboard was not given as well type C charger ..I think if you are buying these laptop now , then you must check realmebook and mi upcoming laptop ..."
3549,5,Fabulous!,"Super work horseLatest processor, ticks all right boxes , economical pricing, Leaves competition far behind. MI (Xiaomi) is set to conquer the laptop market, the way it did in the smart phone & smart tv segments.innovation at its best"
3550,5,Must buy!,"Worth every penny. Awesome performance. All ports available as per my need. Display could have been slightly better but nevertheless it's good. Would have been happier if they had the same laptop in a 14"" screen."
3551,5,Brilliant,Superb laptop with super battery backup. I mostly used this laptop for normal use and meetings on zoom or WebEx. And it gives at least 7 hrs of battery backup with single charge. Also it supports fast charging so this laptop gets fully charged in less than 1.5 hrs which is very good.One thing is missing that type C socket and keyboard light. Otherwise laptop is very fabulous.
3552,5,Classy product,"I bought it at 45k , i5 11 gen which is best at this price , decent look. Now working fine it's only 15days.. so can't say much"
3553,5,Terrific purchase,"Battery :- 3 hours max (biggest cons)Design:- Great look n feel.Performance :- Amazing.Display :- brightness level is good, screen is not IPS panel and so it's not very shiny and side angles visibility is low. But you are buying a laptop and not TV.Also on keyboard, FN key is always On so pressing F1 to F12 Activates function keys instead of F1 to F12 value.To sort this out use FN key + ESC key."
3554,4,Very Good,Everything is good except display. The processor is very fast and battery backup is good. Charging is also fast. Booting time is very small but screen is pathetic. You can't see screen properly at a small angle from screen. Redmi phones are famous for good Quality screens but what did redmi do in laptop screen is hard to understand. I would not recommend this due to screen quality. Go for a good quality LED screen laptop.
3555,5,Super!,"So the laptop is great! At a price of 45k u should go for it the PERFORMANCE is good handles normal tasks and programing very smoothlyI also played games like cod Morden warfare, assassins creed 2, GTAs, farcrys and many okay all I played were the games from 2009 to 2015,16 it performs well with normal heat if u want to play New games it will handle it for sure as the iris Xe does the work pretty well. But it's not for gaming! üòÖBattery is good for normal workOkay so so many people have..."

3559,5,Excellent,At this price point what else you need.1. Superfast latest processor2. Manageable RAM3. Fast Charging4. USP is their Price Point5. Neat built quality6. Crisp clear sound7. Good but not GreatAt this price try to get the same configuration it my challenge to all of you.
3560,5,Worth every penny,"Best for studying purpose.... display is amazing....smart share quility is superb....sound quality also nicee.... processor is fast... camera quality is ok ok...but everything rather then that is very nice ...... Even laptop is beautiful in luks....works amazingly...loved it!!! Only thing is Office was not active, called xiomee then Microsoft customer care for that."
3561,4,Nice product,Really fast becoz of SSD And processor.Display and sound quality is also good.But the battery backup is only 4-5 hours.
3562,2,Expected a better product,"Display quality is not satisfactory in 50k budget...i am disappointed....After usage of 25 days, display quality totally worst....not satisfactory quality..."
3563,3,Does the job,Battery is working only 4 5 hours......not as per committed
3564,5,Brilliant,"As of now, looks decent... Vil share actual working condition in cople of days..."
3565,3,average laptop,laptop under 50k is good but battery only 4to 5 hours and camera quality is very poor just like a keypad phone camerawill update more my review later
3566,5,Fabulous!,Nice product at these price.
3567,1,Waste of money!,"The first day it worked properly (windows 10 set up went successfully). On the second day, the laptop was not booting up. Even the charging light is also not coming while charging is on. Raised replacement. Doubt about the quality and performance. Same problem after replacement. Worst experience with flipkart and redmi."

3569,5,Classy product,It is was very excellent laptopPerformance also excellent given.Battery backup given 7 hours 8 hours
3570,3,Fair,"The performance has been on mark, although this comes at the cheapest price in the segment, I would expect a better build quality for any laptop over 40k.Except for build quality, this laptop does other basics well."
3571,1,Very poor,"I bought it one week ago. After using only for 4 days, screen started becoming black and started blinking suddenly(4-5 times).Though I returned it today and got the refund."

3573,4,Really Nice,Performance was good but the display quality was not that great compare to my another laptop display quality was horrible in this laptop
3574,1,Don't waste your money,Super sonic machine packed in cheap plastic .Looks good while running but when go in details its body too slippery loose its coating in few days of use fragile plastic body ..cannot sustain small chager lid hit.Software is good but sub standard hardware.Disappointed as pro user but one can consider for works online classes or look for other reputed brands.My First Redmi failure üòê‚òπÔ∏è
3575,4,Nice product,Overall ok in this price except camera quality.
3576,4,Good choice,Pros:Performance is very good.Display is good.Value for money.Cons:Battery last only for 5 hours on normal useWebcam is not up to mark.
3577,4,Pretty good,Ticked all the right boxes as all the reviews say but when so many things r tops for this price level (I mean a 15.6 inch laptop with 11th gen iCore5 cpu is simply not avlbl at less than 50k add to that a 500gb ssd and the competition is just blown away) there had 2b a tradeoff somewhere. Unfortunately Xiaomi has chosen that 2b the display quality. They may claim whatever resolution but the colors r a bit off and text isn't crisp which spoils the entire deal coz it's only thru the display one...
3578,5,Worth every penny,Performance is of course really great. Thanks to i5 11gen. Really beautiful design...The only downside is there's no backlit keyboard.Body is built quite sturdy.And yes intel iRIS xe graphics.
3579,5,Super!,Excluding backlit keyboard everything is good
3580,2,Bad quality,"When I ordered this laptop, the screen turned black. The display quality is so poor that my 10 year old laptop has better display quality than this. Definitely not a robust product, very fragile and doesn't satisfy it's price. Don't go for it if you don't want to regret. Build quality is not upto the mark, go for some registered brands"
3581,1,Very poor,Wrong description..Battery doesn't last even for 1.5 hours...it's a cheat in the promo
3582,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Superb
3583,3,Does the job,Bought the laptop thinking that getting i5 at a great deal. And its not even 10 days and the touchpad stopped working. Please dont do the same mistake I did. Spend some more money and buy HP or Dell if u dont want to regret like me.
3584,1,Terrible product,Laptop getting hang after 3hr of use

3594,1,Utterly Disappointed,"I got this laptop today at 5pm after few min when I turned it on, display started flickering like anything. So much so that I can't focus on anything.. Display also goes off in between for few seconds."
3595,2,Average Laptop,"OK laptop but not too good.Average display, 3rd class camera and 2-2.30 hours battery backup.Performance ok ( boot time and response fine)Ok ok for daily use but does not worth for 50 K."
3596,5,Super!,It's awesome! Finally delivered today!
3597,5,Great product,Worth the price
3598,4,Pretty good,The battery is problem but performance is best for big daata or data science Student
3599,4,Wonderful,"Hardware of this laptop is superb. However, since the RAM is soldered and cannot be increased, it has limitation. Display screen is average. Absence of keyboard light is another point against this laptop inasmuch as almost all new laptops have keyboard light inbuilt. The manufacturer should think of increasing RAM to at least 16GB, if anyone needs it for additional cost of RAM with free of cost labour charges at their service center to attract more buyers."
3600,1,Very poor,"Unusable product. Display quality is so poor , you cann't even see the letters properly, Poor viewing angle, 4-5 hrs battery backup max instead of 10 hrs as claimed. Please do not waste your money."

3637,5,Classy product,Loved it
3638,3,Good,"Very good product at almost minimum price, as I bought it in big billion day sale, but in comparison with other brands, this product is highly value for money.

3641,2,Moderate,Product does not seems to be good in comparison with HP. Display is below average and keyboard design is not good
3642,1,Very poor,"BEST LAPTOP I BOUGHT,SHOULD TRY"
3643,4,Delightful,"Performance is great. No issues getting any work done. Battery lasts for around 6hrs. Display is 1080 so its enough. Build is a but flimsy or wobbly. If you are using it without moving it then you are good. If moving from table to sofa, floor, etc then you have should be careful. Then go for MI notebook with metal build"

3763,4,Nice product,"It is one of the best laptop at this price range if you want to go with a good brand name like dell. There is no other laptop at 43k price range which offer this much balance.Instead of investing around 50k for hdd + ssd, i would suggest to go with this 256gb ssd variant and buy an external hdd when needed.Battery life + processing + RAM + size + ssd everything is really good and it also comes with MS office subscription.

3764,4,Good choice,"It's a great budget machine for everyday tasks. SSD makes it work faster. Ryzen 5 performs what it promises. The only drawback I found is the wide bezels. It could have been narrower. If you compare it with other 14"" laptops then you'll find it little bigger in size. But being a dell is a reliable machine."

3770,4,Worth the money,"Laptop is good. In terms of performance, design and display it justifies the price. The battery could have been a little better. Also this laptop heats up more than others ,not a lot but even in small Tasks like multiple tabs and connecting Internet, as soon as you connect it to the charger while using it heats up. If anyone knows how this issue can be fixed please let me know."

3797,1,Utterly Disappointed,"I didn't like this product. Typical Chinese1. Operating system freezes very often while doing work.2. I have to plug headphone jack 3-5 times , after that it takes input.3. Back side of display is so delicate that i can see minor dent on it. ( Ps: never played table tennis with laptop)4. By mistake if you work on a heavy application, fan speed will boost up, laptop will heat like hell and battery gets drained from 100 to 0 within an hour."

This laptop is amazing and working very good till now, laptop with these specs make itself a very Worthy product for students...I would definitely recommend it to buy if you're a student.It has met all my expectations but the issue why I gave it 4 - Stars was it's battery issue,, seriously believe me it drains quickly and gives you around 3-4 hours..Though I understand that there are always sacrifice and compromise in order to gain something better...overall..."

3946,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Apparently, I'm running out of words to describe it so I've given rating. At first blush, I got fascinated with the backlit keyboard ‚ú® that was so enchanting and then arrives the touch experience of the trackpad of the laptop, it was smooth as silk. Overall it's a worthy product at such an affordable price & a non-regrettable purchase in today's life. ‚ù§ü§ò"
3947,5,Terrific purchase,Nice laptop . The look is awesome. Though plastic is used but it is a good quality plastic. The keyboard is very clicky and the backlit keyboard is extremely good. The photo that i have shared is the middle backlit u can go also one level up than that. Ya it is not for gaming. The display is also very good.
3948,5,Just wow!,I've brought this a week ago when only 11 ratings were there and it was 3.8 stars on average.This laptop has the best looks and it's super easy toh handle as it is 1.4 kgs only. The charge stays well for like 4 and half hours. It can game a bit. The keyboard looks very cool. It has that premium feeling when you work on it. The booting time is like 4 or 5 secs. I got it for 39990.The only drawback is that it doesn't have a lab port as it is a sleek book. Go for it.
3949,5,Value for money with cons which won't affect most users,"Good display with decent viewing angles as well as battery backup. It is quick due to SSD and 8GB RAM, Camera is decent for an laptop. Keyboard is good. Fingerprint sensor is quick to recognize. Only thing which bothers me is it hinge. It is delicate and display part shakes a lot while typing in hand or kept under fan.

3958,5,Must buy!,At 40k this is a good buy. As all competitors are not that great looking and portable friendly ( obviously no comparison to macbooks) though with similar specs.

4324,5,Awesome,This laptop is the prime example of value for money. Earlier I was considering to buy Acer Nitro 5 i5 11th gen and then I saw some reviews and youtube and found out that this Ryzen processor is newer and performs better in multi tasking and battery backup is better than the intel counterpart.The laptop is very beautiful especially the ultra violet back lit keyboard and the design of this laptop is just so pretty. I was lucky enough to cop this laptop even when this was out of stock.
4325,5,Best in the market!,No compromise in performance and the thermals are really good in this one.Need to upgrade ram to 16 gb for optimal performance.i have attached valorant gameplay on high settings.It utilises 100 percent gpu thanks to 5600H and gives upwards of 210fps.Update: Was facing CPU overheating issue.Bought a good quality thermal paste and repasted the heat sink.Now provides very good performance with reasonable thermals.

4436,5,Mind-blowing product,"Bought these earphones a week ago and it‚Äôs a brilliant product. Good quality headphones are usually highly-priced, but this pair has great value for money. The sound quality is stellar with an excellent dual EQ feature. Using just the volume controls, you can switch to deep bass mode. It really feels like there's a party going on. I use this mode every time I listen to trance or dubstep. I can always switch back to normal whenever I feel like I want to listen to some John Mayer. Such crisp vo..."
4437,4,Value-for-money,I used it for a month and didn't find more problems. Easily connecting and above average battery. Loved it. Adjustable size is also still working fine. Black colour gives premium look.Thinking this is the best Bluetooth headphone at this rate. Go for it.If this review was helpful please like it.
4438,5,Must buy!,"Everything is worth of Money.I got these for 1599. Comfortable over ear. Volume Control on Right Ear Foam. Bass is too good. Gold Shining Infinity Logo. Compatible with Smartphone, Tablet, Laptops. Battery Life upto 19 hours and 27 mins on Constant Volume. Just one thing ie bad is This is MADE IN CHINA."
4439,4,Very Good,I deducted one star because it doesn't do well as a sound barrier. Means the music can be heard outside if loud please improve that. And otherwise the product is definitely a yes.!! And the bass is never experienced like this before.. Amazing product by JBL
4440,4,Worth the money,"Sound is good.Bass is OK but not that good(turn ON the Dual Equaliser/Deep Bass mode by pressing both volume keys).Headphone is very light weight and keys are simple. Look is also good.Battery backup is fine (although not 20 hrs (as it depends on the level of volume you keep) and also battery will drain faster if you turn ON Dual Equaliser/Deep Bass mode (which most of the users will keep ON for better sound).Overall this worth the price.However, the earcups are a bit small and I feel..."

The battery life is what amazed me and this thing lasts around 1¬Ω days.

For starters any person coming from earphones will definitely love the sound profile in these headphones. Battery life is very satisfying for me.

4463,5,Just wow!,A good headset froma good brand at an affordable price. Don't expect out-of-the-world quality but it's definitely justifies the current price of INR 1599 considering that it's a JBL brand. Worth the money! Go for it!!!
4464,1,Absolute rubbish!,Received this defective piece. It's not turning on . At all. I have put it on charge for more than 4 hrs. The charging indicator turns off after 5 mins. Kept the power button hold . The effing piece of device didn't want to switch on no matter what. If you have seen 5 star reviews. Ot means those guys were lucky to get good device. No return policy on this. You have to go to manufacturers.It's second quality at cheaper rate

The only benifit with this headphone is that it has a long lasting battery life aroun..."

4470,5,Super!,After a week of purchase. A great value for money product. Sound is really good . The deep bass mode is incredible. Pubg lovers will love it. Great battery backup. Requires less amount of time to recharge as well! since it is a overhead headphone ears slightly pain after 3-4 hrs of usage. The pain will work as a reminder to take off the headphone after such long hrs of usage. Overall a great purchase!

4473,4,Really Nice,After using nearly for a month... I realise this is one of the best bluetooth headsets under 1500/-....it has awesome sound quality... awesome bass.... also response at low frequency sound... overall comfortness is above average....main highlight of this product is the battery backup...just awesome battery backup..almost near about 20hrs..but it doesn't have very low latency gaming mode.so sometimes you feel sound lag at the time of playing games.. BTW..I can suggest you...if you have 1500/- ...

4478,5,Worth every penny,"Extremely worth for money as it should cost like 3.5k but you can buy it take only 1.5k. Build and sound quality is amazing and it is very comfortable. The only problem is that it will take a few minutes to adjust it with goggles, btw this is the best on-ear headphone under 1.6k just blindly go for it."

I kinda felt the battery kinda runs out one or two hours faster than what it used to hold when I bought it, but still I only recharge it once two days or three on a medium usage. I don't feel any problems with sound quality, I get the same quality as I bought it. Also I have not used the enhanced mode from the time of purchase, cause I kinda felt that's too much bass. But yeah wort..."

4482,4,Good choice,Everything is good or more than good but if it is sweat proof then it was one of the excellent headphones at this price range
4483,3,Does the job,It is good at this price range. But I would recommend investing some more money and getting a better headphone.Not worth buying this cheap on the ear headphone
4484,4,Pretty good,"Good for music not so good for calls, good battery deep bass is just normal bass and normal bass is neutral I feel. But good bluetooth speakers. Cushioning is good can use for an hour straight but if you are a whole day user consider spending some more bucks and get a good one"
4485,3,Just okay,Not good for pubg game voice delay problm only best for music and video sound is good but u g lover don't by any bluetooth headphone
4486,3,Does the job,It's a good wireless headphone. Although the bass is not as good as expected. If you turn on the deep bass it sounds artificial. My realme bluetooth headphone sounds better. I had to buy it for my kids so it's good considering the requirements. The red color is not exactly red but looks nice and different.

4489,5,Awesome,"I thought that since this is a product from JBL, it's bass quality would be good but it is not at all. I have found that there is no difference between normal and deep bass. So, it's a useless functionality. If I talk about the battery backup, it prvided me more than 24 hours of backup...Hours of usage depletes only 10% of charge. Also, the charging is very fast. I do not find comfort wearing the headset for a longer period as I feel pain on the ear. So, I use it with time gaps. However, I am..."
4490,4,Good quality product,"I liked the product. It has a very good sound quality. It didn't have any audio lagging issues. But, the ear cups become warm after wearing for some time. It is not comfortable to wear for long periods of time and it is tight. It will cause pain if you wear it for a couple of hours."
4491,4,Decent product for the price,"I was mainly looking for a headphone with a good mic quality and that it serves well for that. Mic quality is good.Sound quality is good for the price. Bass could have have been better I felt. I tried both normal and deep bass. Still feel could have been better.Build quality is good. But I cant wear this for long hours. My ears pain. May be its just me. Was never a fan of on ear, ear cups."

4504,5,Simply awesome,One of the best I have ever used. Best part is that sound doesn't comes which was happening with almost every brand I tried.Amazing battery life and good cushion around the ears.The only issue I encountered is the headset is too tight around the head and you feel it after a while otherwise great product.Highly recommended!!!
4505,4,"Pretty good with mobile. But, Not working with Laptop.",This product is really good.. Sound quality is brilliant and noise cancellation is superb. The in-built equalizer is amazing option and one can easily identify the difference between the both modes. Bass is good and well balanced. Only drawback of this product is not its not working with my laptop. Its getting connected successfully but it's not working. I mean the sound is not coming through the headphone though.

4515,5,Super!,Whatever you are expecting with this headphone. It should be definitely delivered.
4516,1,Terrible product,"Product quantity is not up to the level of JBL, and initially only one side speaker was working, so I had given a return request. But I don't know why the flipkart is doing a nonsense behavior since I am a very old customer of flipkart.So I have decided I will never purchase my next item with them."
4517,4,Wonderful,The Infinity Bluetooth headset is really good..i love the sound and the bass..packaging system was truly good!!
4518,2,Could be way better,"This head ph is good for listening music and all.. playing etc but surely not for taking.... microphone is not good at all..after 2days of using, while talking a very disturbing sound is coming constantly from the right side... battery backup is really good."
4519,1,Horrible,"Product quality is Good, but within a month of purchase, its battery charging failed. And only charges upto 20%. I have to send it to Service center which took a week to replace."
4520,4,Good choice,"Worst experience ever to buy this product, if you buy this there is no provisions for replacement, while buying time display shows that 7 days replacement policy"
4521,5,Terrific,"Bass is just awesome and sound quality is also decent.Battery backup is unbelievable ( came down to 60% from 70% ) after 2 days of uses. Built quality is just good. Earcups are well-cushioned but after 2hrs of continuous use, you can feel the heat. The only cons is that it has no headphone jack in it, but its absence is compensated by the huge battery backup.If you are looking for a on-ear headphones with very high battery backup and thumping bass just go for it.‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüëå"
4522,3,Fair,"Designed for light weight. Plastic material. Its Costly I feel because it is very basic design. And required some more quality cushions for ears and over head.Its good for people who use oil for their hairs, can wear since its plastic (non cushioned).And people who don't have hairs. Defnitly This product makes irritates and uncomfortable."
4523,5,Wonderful,"I love this product, music lover must buy this"
4524,3,Does the job,"No question about the sound quality. Amazing sound experience. But the build quality is too low for the cost and for the Brand.Being an ex-Harman employee, didn‚Äôt expect this quality.The buttons touch is rubberised but you can hear spring sounds and hard pressed. The fit is little too tight and the product is small when compared to what we look at the images."
4525,5,Simply awesome,This is mind blowing
4526,4,Delightful,Super bass
4527,5,Must buy!,Excellent Product. The Headphones are too good. The bass is quite good. You can also use this headphones to play games. There is no sound lag or any other issue. I have Boat Rockerz 510 and if I compare this product with that I think the battery backup beats Boat Rockerz 510. I found only one con that there is no Aux cable which is not a major issue.

Built quality is average with plastic body. But again considering the price point, this is a good one."
4537,5,Worth every penny,"Initially I was confused between Boat and Infinity but then decided to go for this, although moto and some other good brands were available in the same range.

The battery life is what amazed me and this thing lasts around 1¬Ω days.

4656,5,Great product,Satisfying . Received today morning. Continuously using this earpods for 3 hrs and still battery is at 90% . So all good. Base can be better but good at this price. Good at calling also. I can hear voice while riding and that's really good. Overall worth buying.

4660,4,Delightful,Good product with fine looks.Bass is not super good but it is ok u can feel beats.connectivity is good overall product is good but one thing hurts me is that it is not waterproof üò≠ and this is a issue for me rest I am happy because it's design is pretty cool .

4662,4,Worth the money,Bass is not upto the mark. Sound quality is excellent. Cryastal clear sound. Boat should improve the bass quality in this airdopes. Boats other headphones having best bass .overall it's good and value for money.
4663,3,Nice,OkUpdated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.
4664,4,Very Good,"I ordered the product in the sale on 22nd Aug & immediately received it on the morning of 23rd Aug.I must say at this price point the product is quite good.Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is."
4665,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst product ever bought. Instead, you can go and try for ""Flipkart smartbuy bass beatz"". A very decent earphones in very reasonable price.

4666,1,Worst experience ever!,"Not at all for bass lover. The music just seems to be soft nor is it loud, there's no loudness at all.

4694,5,Highly recommended,It sounds good and is much worthy for the price... Very happy for it .. thanks to flipkart and boat for the product...
4695,5,Great product,"Worth buying, great product in this price, looking stylish, I like one feature in this we can also connect one earbud with one phone and 2nd with another phone, so that 2 people can use this with different device."
4696,5,Super!,I think it is worth....Sound :- Sound quality is good but sometime music is stop for mili sec...btw in this price range no company provide like this...Build quality :-is good but the blue blinking light irritate me and beacuse of blue light it looks cheap...Battery :- good battery backup ...no problem
4697,5,Brilliant,"Liked the product. However, this one is not for the music lover. But for general use, its amazing. Battery life cant say much as its too early. The best thing is it matches my bedroom wall...well be a little cautious with the colors they are not exactly how it is shown in the pics. Mine turned more towards baby pink..."
4698,4,Good choice,Over all it‚Äôs good product.Design - 6/10Sound - 7/10Bass - 5/10Battery -7/10Calling -7/10Design could get better but still in this price it‚Äôs a good product.
4699,3,Does the job,The sound quality is good in this price. The battery backup is nice I use it all the time still I have charged it 1 time in 4-5 days. This thing I really like.I don't like it design as it kept on falling from ears it kind of frustrating. If you are thinking to buy this for gym workout or running it not suitable.
4700,5,Awesome,The Product Is Great It Is Comfortable It's Sounds Great Too And I used it to do gaming too and ya it performs great when playing games No Audio Lag NothingAt Last I want To Say Thanks To Bot For Making Such Great Products
4701,3,Just okay,Bass is zeroSound quality is goodDesign is so good and coolBattery backup is goodSound and bass is not so good as expected from boat
4702,3,Does the job,Don't expect bass... decent audio quality not so great ... Good for calls and mic works well ..fits perfectly in ear but continues usuage will get pain in ears as the size is little bigOverall value for money product
4703,5,Excellent,This product is good üéßSo please buy NowAnd 1 Year warranty this prodecut isVery usefulSo please BuyMara tharaph sa 4 üåü üåü üåü üåüThis product is superplease buy now
4704,5,Highly recommended,"The best in class airdopes. Great sound, perfect fit and at this price it's just awesome. Highly recommended.The only issue is that Boat has mentioned additional earmuffs with the package but it is not available in the box or it is missing."
4705,5,Fabulous!,Nice product amazing sound quality. I gifted to my daughters each one set both are very happy. Worth for money and prompt delivery.
4706,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Excellent bass as well as battery backup it's awesome just go for it... Leave negative reviews just go for it I got it worth 999 during freedom sale
4707,5,Just wow!,Mind blowing parches. Very nice headset in low budget. Go for it. I think this is the best in this price range. I ordered on 22 August and got it on 23 August. Very fast delivery. Thanks flipkart.
4708,4,Good choice,Really amazing product its really having a long time battery backup nice sound with good quality i would like to request make another one with same features but with sensor quality.. Thank you FLILPKART AND BOAT
4709,4,Pretty good,"If you are looking for a earbuds only listening music then its a good choice but not good for communication.While talking on phone or laptops second person is not able to here your voice clearly i.e. not good in connectivity.Bass is not good, its average.Build quality and battery life is extremely great."
4710,5,Terrific purchase,Boat is just super noone can beat ....in this range best earpods .... battery is super and sound is terrificFast delivery by Flipkart thanks
4711,5,Classy product,"Pros-Perfect fit, great battery life, great sound quality,looks classy, great in callingCons-Not for people who want extreme bass other than that balanced sound quality.I got these in just 999 so in this price range a great product and yes much better then mivi duopods m20."
4712,4,Nice product,"This is good only... If your looking for fast beat with high bass, then don't go with this product. Else go for it and it will be worth for amount."
4713,5,Wonderful,Awesome product with this price range. Nice build quality and very comfortable for long duration use. Impressed with the battery backup. Go for it.üòäüëç
4714,4,Nice product,"So,Okay. I don't know why I was thinking it would be a bit larger in size. But all and all, a really good product. BOAT never Disappoints.The sound quality is really clear. Don't expect alot of Bass from it though. But it's really nice that it lacks a bit Bass, and has a really clear sound quality. It just arrived so I'm not sure about the battery backup feature. But, I'm really happy with the product.the colours would come a bit lighter in shade. I chose Cherry blossom, but it's more lik..."
4715,3,Decent product,"I wish to point out one very basic thing the earbuds are designed well but the material used for covering the sound outlet is no good it in good brands its steel or metal based very fine mesh, in this case it just came out to be nothing but a cloth based thin layer pasted with low quality glue. Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore."
4716,1,Worst experience ever!,"As a music producer and DJ i don't like this sound quality it sounds like a earphones from 2012, i know in earbuds u wouldn't get that much bass it is lower than normal bass u would get other products, it has a great design and quality also battery backup is goodPersonally I didn't like the sound quality and the design if I use the buds for longer than 1hr it would hurt like hell since i couldn't return the item i just threw them in the trash was disappointed very muchif your a average us..."
4717,5,Simply awesome,It is the best gifted item ever with in the price range I personally use airpod i purchased it to gift someone and I compared it to my AirPods all designs and connectivity is same and good built up only think the blinking light is really irritating and sound clarity is also good range power is also nice I highly recommended it if u r having less budget
4718,5,Best in the market!,Great Product1. Worth of the money.2. Good sound quality and bass also.3. Nice design with comfort.4. Good battery backup.5. Best in the market.
4719,5,Best in the market!,"I am a bit skeptical about buying electronics online. But thanks to the seller I have got a good shopping experience. I don't know much about bass or everything. But it has good build smooth sound, received a perfect product."
4720,4,Pretty good,"All are excellent but it is not connected well with Microsoft Teams call because in other end can't hear properly, so unable to use it for official call. But if you're using only with mobile then it's too good without any doubt. Additionally, it won't block your ear hole fully so you'll get enough ventilation for your ear which eliminate ear problems."
4721,4,Good choice,See this is like the best u can get in 1299 there is just one problem u see when unbox and connect for first time only one get connected u have to factory reset to that part is hilarious I was shocked first then I made it correct and bass and sound should be improved
4722,5,Simply awesome,This pair of headset is perfectly fine and worth every penny. The sound quality is absolutely clear with defined bass. Mic works perfectly fine. Also perfectly suitable for people who wear earphones during driving. Though it is risky but still works absolutely good. Battery is good. Perfect airdopes at reasonable price.
4723,5,Excellent,It was a gift for my husband.. and he like it a lot.. sound quality is very nice also I love the color.. thank you for the great service ü§©

4725,5,Classy product,Hope this review helps you out ..The product is nice built quality is good .but don't expect too much bcoz it's a budget friendly product .Sound is also nice but bass is not enough ..
4726,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Very nice product and bass vary smoothly nice battery backup good
4727,5,Fabulous!,"Bass quality should be better,But in this price range its goodBattery backup is greatCall quality is excelentIn simple words those are Good Duo pods"
4728,3,Decent product,Charging and look are good but sound is bad sound of right eardopes are very less compare to left one and bass is also nice but fitting in ear is good but after some times it will pain.Overall I give it 3/5.
4729,5,Simply awesome,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it.3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look."
4730,4,Wonderful,"Sound quality is above average and bass is low , design and look is amazing. At this price range it is a great deal . If you are a good music lover do not go for this, for call purposes it is good."
4731,5,Great product,"I using these Headset for last 2 days. The experience with my Boat Airpods 131 Bluetooth Headset is nice. But the price (Rs-1,299)of the product is very costly.

4743,5,Best in the market!,Superb worthy product üòä I Love it thank you flipcart
4744,4,Wonderful,Overall A Very Good Product on BudgetSound Quality could be a little more better but can't complain much for a budget device like this. Very easy to pair and setup and excellent battery life. As all always after sale service by Boat is EXCELLENT.
4745,5,Best in the market!,Good product good sound quality and good battery backup best price and best valuable item
4746,5,Just wow!,Best product but bass is less battery is also best design is also best and sound quality is also best but bass is less
4747,4,Wonderful,"Some of the reviews here are overrated.- The battery backup is really nice.- No compatibility problems, however it doesn't support AAC sound attributes in some devices.- One of my Pods has excellent bass, the other one's okay.- Mono pod feature works well- You can't control the volume with these, it has to be controlled by device you're connected to.Probably the best you can get for 1300 INR"
4748,5,Brilliant,Best earbuds in range of 2500 or i can say in 3000.... Backup voice quality both excellent instant pairing is best
4749,5,Great product,"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price, THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkartüòçüòç"
4750,4,Delightful,Good product with fine looks.Bass is not super good but it is ok u can feel beats.connectivity is good overall product is good but one thing hurts me is that it is not waterproof üò≠ and this is a issue for me rest I am happy because it's design is pretty cool . I had already one plus wireless earphone but whenever I use it it's neck wire irritates meüòÇ
4751,5,Excellent,Loved the sound quality loved the base and the bild quality is awesome üëçüëçüëçüëç I love it plzzz go for it best airpods in this price buy it right now n for pubg also best it is üî•üî•üëçüëç
4752,4,Worth the money,Bass is not upto the mark. Sound quality is excellent. Cryastal clear sound. Boat should improve the bass quality in this airdopes. Boats other headphones having best bass .overall it's good and value for money.
4753,3,Nice,OkUpdated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.
4754,4,Very Good,"I ordered the product in the sale on 22nd Aug & immediately received it on the morning of 23rd Aug.I must say at this price point the product is quite good.Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is."
4755,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst product ever bought. Instead, you can go and try for ""Flipkart smartbuy bass beatz"". A very decent earphones in very reasonable price. Never go for boat airdopes 131 as this is just good in look and WORST in performance. Could have given 0 star if available in option."
4756,1,Worst experience ever!,"Not at all for bass lover. The music just seems to be soft nor is it loud, there's no loudness at all. According to the price it should've been a bit more worth it building up the bass & for bass lovers there's no bass at all. Giving an honest review from the day of purchase & delivered."
4757,1,Hated it!,Although design is gud in look but the sound quality is cheapest...not only cheapest...its too cheapest and annoying...üò£Not satisfied at this price... Boat rockerzz 255 is too much better then these eardopes at this price rate...üëéüëéüëéI have boat eardopes 281 which is also very good in sound and design...
4758,5,Worth every penny,"And yes there you go...You have the best in-budget tws....First of all, let me get something straight- It has amazing sound qualityA decent bassA nice battery backupBut it lacks only in built design. Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...Just go for it"

4764,5,Excellent,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" üòÑüòÑüòâ"
4765,5,Super!,"Nice headphone, bass was very good and sound is clear. I am purchase for calling purpose and best choice even riding on bike wear in one ear and opposite end voice was clear and no complaint for calling.. Battery backup 1 full day"
4766,5,Super!,"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good."
4767,5,Terrific purchase,Sound quality super battery backup super quality super this price range super and this value for money
4768,4,Pretty good,Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.
4769,5,Terrific purchase,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet.."
4770,5,Simply awesome,It's a very good product ... I'm so happy with this BCz its bass quality & sounds is too good & batry back up Also super
4771,4,Delightful,First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good. I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.
4772,5,Simply awesome,Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great üëå and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great

4774,4,Good choice,Nice build quality.. bass is best it self.. vibrate at call is nice. .. nice support from flipkart and delivery partner
4775,1,Worthless,This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please
4776,3,Does the job,Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating)
4777,1,Terrible product,"After using for about 8 days, right side of the earphone is not working properly and the volume on right side is very low. I didn't expect this."
4778,4,Good quality product,It's a very good product... I'm so happy with this Bcz it's bass quality & sounds is too good & battery backup also superb
4779,1,Useless product,Mic is not proper recipient persons can't hear proper sound ( every time for call I heard from front I can't hear you so I have to again talk to through Mobile phone no Option useless of wirless meaning) and sound quality is so loud. Like local headphones. not comfortable to wear for more than1 hrs of uses.tere is no meanings to get replaced again you get same product therefore this is wast of money.

4793,5,Excellent,It's a Awesome purchase. Value for money. I can't expect that type of sound and connectivity will get in this price range. Last time I bought Boult ear buds and refunded due to charging issue and connectivity issue. That sound was not as powerful as this Boat headphone provides. Really happy to advise all of you if are searching for Bluetooth headphones please go for it. You will get everything you are searching for. Thanks Flipcart. And request all of you please go for only Indian Products.

4858,5,Brilliant,"Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good."
4859,5,Terrific purchase,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet.."

4865,1,Worthless,This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please
4866,3,Does the job,Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating)

4971,5,Highly recommended,This Earbuds are truly for Bass lovers with everlasting battery really it's great 42 hours of playtime and it has 13mm drivers which is nicely done by the company and a plus point it comes with 10 min charge = 10 hours of battery backup that is really highlighted spec and obviously made in india really worthy product
4972,4,Very Good,product is overall good in this price range ...battery backup is awesome sound quality is good ..in advertise it shows 13mm driver but in box it shows 10mm.. dont know whats tha issue..and mpst important think about noise cancellation or mic is that it is not good just cam say average...cause lack of n.c. and poor mic quality

4987,5,Great product,"Rockerz 255pro+ is excellent and value for money product by Boat.Battery backup is also outstanding, build,sound quality and performance also mind blowing.I am really happy with this neckband also it is comfortable for ears."
4988,4,Wonderful,This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging. Sound is good but bass could have been more and better. Have to use and check more for better opinion. Call quality is good though... Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.
4989,3,Does the job,"Boat is getting better in sound over time and this one is my 4th product, still it suffering to produce clarity. But it is disappointing to see the cheap materials and lousy designs are been accepted. Material quality is no at all near to good, thats means it won't last long.

5079,3,Does the job,"Boat is getting better in sound over time and this one is my 4th product, still it suffering to produce clarity. But it is disappointing to see the cheap materials and lousy designs are been accepted. Material quality is no at all near to good, thats means it won't last long. Battery backup is really good, been 27 hours and still running, though battery housing is not sealed properly to provide IPX7 capability, Image attached.Now, the bass is better then others in this range but bellow 70 H..."
5080,5,Must buy!,As compared to any other company models and even boat most famous model this is the best product. With a dedicated mic and enormous battery backup. I don't suppose any other blutooth headset can compete with this. I have tried and tested with my office calls and response was amazing. Due to to Covid situation Work from home this product is the best support. It connects with my Laptop and mobile at the same time. And I can easily switch between concalls and online calls work great throughout ...
5081,5,Perfect product!,"I can say, This is a best Neckband I have ever seen. I got this product on 16 August evening & I used this Neckband till now continuously but it showing 20% battery. Actually I was confused between One Plus bullet & Boat 255 pro plus. So, I used both but one plus Neckband is looking like cheapest Neckband but Now I am using boat & it's look like an expensive Neckband.

5082,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"The battery life is really amazing, on average use of 4-5 hrs per day it lasts upto 5-6 days on 50-60% volume. Also the fast charging really works, you will get 10hrs battery backup with 10 minutes of charge, whereas it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge which is good.The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good.The build quality is also nice, it feels durable and the fit is good and snuggly.My opinion:- Its the best bluetooth collar band in this price segme..."

5084,5,Fabulous!,"Excellent product. !Very good Sound/Bass quality, nd battery backup is amazing ü§ó.. No other brands can challenge the Boat. Earlier Sony was good, but ever since the boat came, it became everyone's best choice."
5085,1,Terrible product,"Its only 7 months I bought this product. It was convenient for me to use. Sound,Bass everything is good but. It said it has water & sweat resistance power. I never worked out wearing these not splashed any water but still one side stopped working in 1 second without any warning. I feel like I wasted my money in this. Wired earphones work longer than this."

5089,5,Best in the market!,Amazing sound quality with boosted Bass. But if your r listing music on YouTube then might the sound quality may not that good as u experience on Gaana aap or related music app or music that you have download on your cell phone. Don't worry for that it only differ slightly i.e. unpredictable. Overall you will get owsm sound and bass experiences. Coming to the battery backup it is up to 6hrs + and charges quickly for urgent work.The build quality is good and has a magnetic end that don't work...

5098,4,Good choice,"Just received Yesterday, Sound Quality and Battery Good, Bluetooth Range is Good in Open Space, but at home it's range is little low , It's range not properly available beyond walls , Cables made in good Quality, it's little hard & Long , Short &flexible cables more suitable to use i think, , overall after using one day it's nice product, only facing trouble is that connection/ Bluetooth range not available in another room due to walls i think"
5099,1,Not recommended at all,"It's very awful experience with the brand like boat .The boat Rockerz Headset has stopped working after only a month of purchasing. First it's the right side headphone become silent and with in a week the left side. Don't buy, and overall don't trust blindly the brand name."

5101,1,Terrible product,"The battery suddenly go from 60% to 0% and then headphones turned off. Don't recommend this due this type of battery issue. I've read lots of comments saying that battery suddenly drop from 60% to 0%. Apart from battery issue the sound quality is decent not great like JBL. Also the noise cancellation is very bad, the person on the other end of the call can't hear voice properly."

5107,4,Pretty good,"Great earphones, one of the best piece in this price,Pros:1. Sound quality is good.2. Bass is great.3. Calling but when there is no other noise, it will work great.Cons:1. Battery backup, it directly shows 80% to 20%, no middle alert or display in phone.2. I have used them for approx 2 weeks, they are good for short time but not for long usage."
5108,4,Very Good,nice product this product is for who loving bass and easy to hold in ear .it feel comfortable you may download equalizer app for Better experience.
5109,5,Mind-blowing purchase,This earphone has very good sound quality and bass is really superb and battery backup also good 4-5 hours and their built quality is also good & impressive look.
5110,2,Could be way better,Bass is good but not as good as what you expect. streaming source will decide the quality of sound. Gaana and wynk I didn't find that exceptional audio. but it is decent when played via YouTube and Netflix. just one day use. will update details very soon.
5111,5,Perfect product!,"I have got boat rockers 510( Last yr) and this is my second boat rockers 225( I got for gyming purpose ) as I had it ordered earlier ( in jan ) to gift my dad. It's quite gud and is as competitive as jbl, sony, oppo or senhiesser. Its a total made in India product ( HQ- mumbai) and i intended to buy made in India product as I felt it's well upto par with many Int'l brands in that price tag. Kudos for reading my review."

5115,4,Worth the money,Got this amazing product today.. ... I m a boAt lover .. it has a beautiful sound and outstanding bass.. I will check it battery backup soon.. Thanks Flipkart bt poor Courier Partner..
5116,2,Bad quality,Ear phones (buds) are bigger and not comfortable for long use.Sound quality is average and bass strength is below average.Battery backup is fine for continuous use of 5-6 hrs...but low battery kicks in at 40% and stops earphone functioning.Price can be more competitive since the product doesn't have the quality against the competition
5117,2,Bad quality,Used for 1 month it was nice... Later I was not using.... Again After 6 months started using... Worked for two months properly n right side stopped working... N after 1 month left side also gone....

5162,4,Delightful,"To be honest, I bought this for someone else. I must say, I am amazed by the crispness of sound. The tone and vocals are quite good, however about this extra bass, I don't know how much this helps, but I dont think it adds to the beauty of music. The voice cracks at full volume due to the extra bass. Also, about the sweat and water proof feature, I used it once or twice in the gym. Works fine, since I sweat a lot. Well, battery backup is beyond expectation. Plays for 5ish at a stretch. Saw tw..."
5163,1,Hated it!,"It's not that good for calls , It is good only for music.Mic is worst , not able to take calls while riding cycle or bike.Blat should work on Mic quality and Mic/ Battery performance rest everything is good ."
5164,5,Terrific,Best wireless earphone under 1k.Bass is damm awesome.Design is almost good but wire is a little bit small.If you buy for listening bass boosted audios then good otherwise you have to use an equalizer if you listen to mood calming music as the clarity of sound would lack because of bass.You can't play PUBG or any shooting or battle royal games as there is time delay which can get you killed before you get aware of enemies.
5165,4,Delightful,Earphone is much better with compassion to price... But when volume is full bass clarity found little poor.. Go for it guys.... Good product..
5166,1,Worst experience ever!,1. Design and build up qualify is not good as per rate2. Sound quality is also not good as per rate
5167,5,Brilliant,Nice Product Recived Today Very Good Sound Quality And Very Good Bass But It's Not Soo Good For Pubg But Ok Over All Value For Money

5172,4,Really Nice,"What to say about the product,very much satisfied with the sound quality and the bass,bass is also good but not comparable with the wired one.Connnectivity is good but could be improved but the back up time is fabulous.Overall a very good product in this range"

5174,4,Really Nice,"Nice deal at 999 Rs. I am not a sound quality expert but its good as compare to Samsung Level U. It has enough Bass, Noise cancellation and Sound clarity. Light weight and Good design. The only con I feel after using for around 4 months, The Mic is not positioned well sometimes I need to hold it near to my mouth while on call in a crowdy place."
5175,5,Excellent,"Awesome product. The best neckband in this price range. No other neckband is comparable to this. I even tried the Boult curve, and the experience was worst. So I highly recommend Boat Rockerz 255 to all."

5182,2,Slightly disappointed,It's not good for some days it is good after some month it's a not good sound quality is not good sound we can't hear properly

5326,5,Wonderful,Its a must buy earphn for sure...DESIGN COULD BE BETTWR MAY BE A BETTER COLOUR COMBINATION..who r looking for a wired earphn may be becoz of online meetings n all....they can go for it.....it includes mic and a good grip too for the ears as well as is gentle for the ears....extra buds included too!.....its a #musthave deal
5327,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."
5328,5,Worth every penny,Sound quality is amazing and build quantity is also amazing my brother is also using this ear buds 1 for long time and its performance is still very good so I also ordered ear buds 2 and both are amazing and working up to expectations.

5336,5,Awesome,Using since May 6th. And it is exceptional. Especially for pubg it's wonderful you can hear the footsteps form where they are coming. There were no problem listing music for long hours. Active noise cancellation is superb you did not hear anything around you when you plug and play.I previously used Mi basic after 1 year one side went not working. This one has better bass and sound clarity than Mi basic headset. Go for it guys
5337,4,Good quality product,every thing is great in this earphone just lacks clarity a bit and i guess its because of bass.cable: braidedlooks cool with black yellow combinationi like the magnetic earbuds

5344,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.v."

5358,5,Terrific,The quality of the earphone is very good it may comepete with the earphones which are about 1500 rs to 2000 rs the bass and treble are so nice but due to bass the vocals may affected a little but in your day to day usage you don't feel but those who are bass lovers like me the absolutely prefer this earphoneGood luck

5362,4,Nice product,Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain.
5363,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
5364,5,Terrific purchase,It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget.

5367,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.This is my second pair of these earp..."
5368,4,Value-for-money,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered.Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt...
5386,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."

5394,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
5395,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."

5450,1,Very poor,Just like any another earphones. Bass is not that special as said. Bass is normal like you get in any other normal earphone. It was a disspointment as they said this is a bass special. Now only thing that will determine if these are good is the time. If they survived for 1 year without any fault then I will say they are good otherwise they are bad cause there is nothing special in this earphone.
5451,5,Must buy!,"The best earphones I've ever ordered. They are very handy, cute and the sound quality is superb! The delivery was before time. Got it 3 days before the due date. Thank you Flipkart !"

5461,5,Terrific,"the quality of earphones are just fine, the length is right. There's enough bass. For this price range, is this probably the best you could get.

5474,3,Does the job,"guys, this is my genuine review. If you combine the sound and bass of the earphone, the sound is very low, and bass I kinda cool. if u wanna here some mass songs in this earphone or watch some action trailers in this earphone you'll be disappointed coz it only has bass. No sound even in full volume. but it's also kinda good for ur ears and head. if u come to it's design, man it's superbly made with that hawk inspiration. and also the wires are also very thick where there'll not be any damage ..."
5475,5,Terrific,That's good product their sound quality is Rich and comfortable to use it . My suggestion to bought blindly without any hesitation. Thank you Flipkart for providing such a better product or fastest delivery services.
5476,5,Highly recommended,"Prefer buying JBL C200SI, but at this price point, its good. If the jack would have been gold plated, it would have been the best wired earphone. It's design is great and is really comfortable. If you use it rough, it could last by mid of 4th month from the date of purchase. So yeah it's good."
5477,5,Just wow!,"I bought 1more and boAt BassHeads 100 headphones together, sound clarity, volume, bass and treble of boAt is much better than 1More. Comfortable ear buds, Zara Hatke design, sleek packaging. You don't wanna listen to music without boAt headphones. Truly price worthy."

5484,4,Good choice,"It is good sound quality is also good but sometimes sound fluctuation happens in the earphone. I like the designing, colour is my fav, not sure about the durablity but sound quality is good."
5485,5,Terrific,Writing this review after 6 months of usage.Sound clarity is very good. Not a single issue had come till now with it. The bass is nice but if you want more bass then I suggest you to go with the other product i.e. BoAt Bassheads 103. But if it's not the case then this one is best for you. It's truly value for money! Go for it!
5486,5,Wonderful,I purchased this on 7th june 2019 and one side of the earphone stopepd working and the jack was also become loose . When i applied for the warranty it took one month to come but the best thing is they gave me a new one . It's awesome yaar . I liked the assurity of boat .

The first two were great and this one (the bassheads 900) is the best of the lot!Boat headsets are definitely more bass oriented and don't provide a very balanced output - you can always feel more of the bass without tweaking eq. But, if you're a bass lover, this is the thing to buy at this range. It gets better and better as they are used for some time. This headset is very comfortable and the build quality is pretty good..."

6052,5,Simply awesome,"I was looking for a headset that would last the day with me. I am not really too fond of constantly charging my devices during the day. That's when a friend recommended that I buy the glide headset. It was quite a wait, but I was super excited when I got it. I mostly use the headphones to answer the calls through the day. And I was so relieved when I did not see the battery go down that day. I have just charged it just once in last 3 days. I recommend this headset for anybody looking for some..."

6054,5,Mind-blowing product,"Bought these earphones a week ago and it‚Äôs a brilliant product. Good quality headphones are usually highly-priced, but this pair has great value for money. The sound quality is stellar with an excellent dual EQ feature. Using just the volume controls, you can switch to deep bass mode. It really feels like there's a party going on. I use this mode every time I listen to trance or dubstep. I can always switch back to normal whenever I feel like I want to listen to some John Mayer. Such crisp vo..."
6055,4,Value-for-money,I used it for a month and didn't find more problems. Easily connecting and above average battery. Loved it. Adjustable size is also still working fine. Black colour gives premium look.Thinking this is the best Bluetooth headphone at this rate. Go for it.If this review was helpful please like it.
6056,5,Must buy!,"Everything is worth of Money.I got these for 1599. Comfortable over ear. Volume Control on Right Ear Foam. Bass is too good. Gold Shining Infinity Logo. Compatible with Smartphone, Tablet, Laptops. Battery Life upto 19 hours and 27 mins on Constant Volume. Just one thing ie bad is This is MADE IN CHINA."
6057,4,Very Good,I deducted one star because it doesn't do well as a sound barrier. Means the music can be heard outside if loud please improve that. And otherwise the product is definitely a yes.!! And the bass is never experienced like this before.. Amazing product by JBL
6058,4,Worth the money,"Sound is good.Bass is OK but not that good(turn ON the Dual Equaliser/Deep Bass mode by pressing both volume keys).Headphone is very light weight and keys are simple. Look is also good.Battery backup is fine (although not 20 hrs (as it depends on the level of volume you keep) and also battery will drain faster if you turn ON Dual Equaliser/Deep Bass mode (which most of the users will keep ON for better sound).Overall this worth the price.However, the earcups are a bit small and I feel..."

6065,5,Worth every penny,"Initially I was confused between Boat and Infinity but then decided to go for this, although moto and some other good brands were available in the same range. It's a sub brand of JBL, even then there must be something... thinking of that went for this. But I was not wrong. Product is superb although bit bassy. Comfortable on ear.

The battery life is what amazed me and this thing lasts around 1¬Ω days.

6075,4,Great value for the price !!,"I bought these headphones during offer days for 1200/- and had been using for past 4 days. I am no audiophile and these are my first headphones, so any person like me can relate to this review. For starters any person coming from earphones will definitely love the sound profile in these headphones. Battery life is very satisfying for me.

6081,5,Just wow!,A good headset froma good brand at an affordable price. Don't expect out-of-the-world quality but it's definitely justifies the current price of INR 1599 considering that it's a JBL brand. Worth the money! Go for it!!!
6082,1,Absolute rubbish!,Received this defective piece. It's not turning on . At all. I have put it on charge for more than 4 hrs. The charging indicator turns off after 5 mins. Kept the power button hold . The effing piece of device didn't want to switch on no matter what. If you have seen 5 star reviews. Ot means those guys were lucky to get good device. No return policy on this. You have to go to manufacturers.It's second quality at cheaper rate

6086,3,Decent product,"Bought this product around 11 days from now, the quality of material used in the headphone is kinda cheap, well the cost cutting you can guess while wearing the headphone if you press any key and the music is not shuffling you could feel the sound of the button. Talking about the sound quality, bass, comfort, etc. I guess the boat rockers 450 are far more comfortable and have a better base and sound quality. The only benifit with this headphone is that it has a long lasting battery life aroun..."

6088,5,Super!,After a week of purchase. A great value for money product. Sound is really good . The deep bass mode is incredible. Pubg lovers will love it. Great battery backup. Requires less amount of time to recharge as well! since it is a overhead headphone ears slightly pain after 3-4 hrs of usage. The pain will work as a reminder to take off the headphone after such long hrs of usage. Overall a great purchase!

6091,4,Really Nice,After using nearly for a month... I realise this is one of the best bluetooth headsets under 1500/-....it has awesome sound quality... awesome bass.... also response at low frequency sound... overall comfortness is above average....main highlight of this product is the battery backup...just awesome battery backup..almost near about 20hrs..but it doesn't have very low latency gaming mode.so sometimes you feel sound lag at the time of playing games.. BTW..I can suggest you...if you have 1500/- ...

But according to me it's not that much bad. It has a descent build quality. We can't expect more at this price range. Also there is no complaints in comfort department. Yeah it's not the perfect one. I don't know about other headphones at this price range. But it is better than my boat rockerz 400 in terms of sound quality, build qu..."
6094,5,Awesome,Sound quality is good design is good but i don't like to comment about battery because i am new user.
6095,5,Just wow!,Connected to TV. Feeling like direct listening. Head band conveniently widened to avoid tightness and pressure on the ears. Performance is excellent with clarity and sensitivity. Extremely satisfied.
6096,5,Worth every penny,"Extremely worth for money as it should cost like 3.5k but you can buy it take only 1.5k. Build and sound quality is amazing and it is very comfortable. The only problem is that it will take a few minutes to adjust it with goggles, btw this is the best on-ear headphone under 1.6k just blindly go for it."

6098,5,Must buy!,"It's been two or three months after buying this, I don't see any problems, it works just like when I brought it. I kinda felt the battery kinda runs out one or two hours faster than what it used to hold when I bought it, but still I only recharge it once two days or three on a medium usage. I don't feel any problems with sound quality, I get the same quality as I bought it. Also I have not used the enhanced mode from the time of purchase, cause I kinda felt that's too much bass. But yeah wort..."
6099,5,Worth every penny,"This have monster battery backup ,I have turned this on for 3 days because I have forgotten to turn it off and still it is working. Very nice bass, it's bass is like home theater. And sound quality is super. And at a low cost I prefer everyone to buy it."
6100,4,Good choice,Everything is good or more than good but if it is sweat proof then it was one of the excellent headphones at this price range
6101,3,Does the job,It is good at this price range. But I would recommend investing some more money and getting a better headphone.Not worth buying this cheap on the ear headphone
6102,4,Pretty good,"Good for music not so good for calls, good battery deep bass is just normal bass and normal bass is neutral I feel. But good bluetooth speakers. Cushioning is good can use for an hour straight but if you are a whole day user consider spending some more bucks and get a good one"
6103,3,Just okay,Not good for pubg game voice delay problm only best for music and video sound is good but u g lover don't by any bluetooth headphone
6104,3,Does the job,It's a good wireless headphone. Although the bass is not as good as expected. If you turn on the deep bass it sounds artificial. My realme bluetooth headphone sounds better. I had to buy it for my kids so it's good considering the requirements. The red color is not exactly red but looks nice and different.
6105,5,Brilliant,"üéâIt is amazing üéß Quality/Sound/Battery everything is bestüëçThis product is exceptional and quality of the product values like 3k but surprisingly being sold at a very reasonable price.

6107,5,Awesome,"I thought that since this is a product from JBL, it's bass quality would be good but it is not at all. I have found that there is no difference between normal and deep bass. So, it's a useless functionality. If I talk about the battery backup, it prvided me more than 24 hours of backup...Hours of usage depletes only 10% of charge. Also, the charging is very fast. I do not find comfort wearing the headset for a longer period as I feel pain on the ear. So, I use it with time gaps. However, I am..."
6108,4,Good quality product,"I liked the product. It has a very good sound quality. It didn't have any audio lagging issues. But, the ear cups become warm after wearing for some time. It is not comfortable to wear for long periods of time and it is tight. It will cause pain if you wear it for a couple of hours."
6109,4,Decent product for the price,"I was mainly looking for a headphone with a good mic quality and that it serves well for that. Mic quality is good.Sound quality is good for the price. Bass could have have been better I felt. I tried both normal and deep bass. Still feel could have been better.Build quality is good. But I cant wear this for long hours. My ears pain. May be its just me. Was never a fan of on ear, ear cups."

6122,5,Simply awesome,One of the best I have ever used. Best part is that sound doesn't comes which was happening with almost every brand I tried.Amazing battery life and good cushion around the ears.The only issue I encountered is the headset is too tight around the head and you feel it after a while otherwise great product.Highly recommended!!!
6123,4,"Pretty good with mobile. But, Not working with Laptop.",This product is really good.. Sound quality is brilliant and noise cancellation is superb. The in-built equalizer is amazing option and one can easily identify the difference between the both modes. Bass is good and well balanced. Only drawback of this product is not its not working with my laptop. Its getting connected successfully but it's not working. I mean the sound is not coming through the headphone though.

6133,5,Super!,Whatever you are expecting with this headphone. It should be definitely delivered.
6134,1,Terrible product,"Product quantity is not up to the level of JBL, and initially only one side speaker was working, so I had given a return request. But I don't know why the flipkart is doing a nonsense behavior since I am a very old customer of flipkart.So I have decided I will never purchase my next item with them."
6135,4,Wonderful,The Infinity Bluetooth headset is really good..i love the sound and the bass..packaging system was truly good!!
6136,2,Could be way better,"This head ph is good for listening music and all.. playing etc but surely not for taking.... microphone is not good at all..after 2days of using, while talking a very disturbing sound is coming constantly from the right side... battery backup is really good."
6137,1,Horrible,"Product quality is Good, but within a month of purchase, its battery charging failed. And only charges upto 20%. I have to send it to Service center which took a week to replace."
6138,4,Good choice,"Worst experience ever to buy this product, if you buy this there is no provisions for replacement, while buying time display shows that 7 days replacement policy"
6139,5,Terrific,"Bass is just awesome and sound quality is also decent.Battery backup is unbelievable ( came down to 60% from 70% ) after 2 days of uses. Built quality is just good. Earcups are well-cushioned but after 2hrs of continuous use, you can feel the heat. The only cons is that it has no headphone jack in it, but its absence is compensated by the huge battery backup.If you are looking for a on-ear headphones with very high battery backup and thumping bass just go for it.‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüëå"
6140,3,Fair,"Designed for light weight. Plastic material. Its Costly I feel because it is very basic design. And required some more quality cushions for ears and over head.Its good for people who use oil for their hairs, can wear since its plastic (non cushioned).And people who don't have hairs. Defnitly This product makes irritates and uncomfortable."
6141,5,Wonderful,"I love this product, music lover must buy this"
6142,3,Does the job,"No question about the sound quality. Amazing sound experience. But the build quality is too low for the cost and for the Brand.Being an ex-Harman employee, didn‚Äôt expect this quality.The buttons touch is rubberised but you can hear spring sounds and hard pressed. The fit is little too tight and the product is small when compared to what we look at the images."
6143,5,Simply awesome,This is mind blowing
6144,4,Delightful,Super bass
6145,5,Must buy!,Excellent Product. The Headphones are too good. The bass is quite good. You can also use this headphones to play games. There is no sound lag or any other issue. I have Boat Rockerz 510 and if I compare this product with that I think the battery backup beats Boat Rockerz 510. I found only one con that there is no Aux cable which is not a major issue.

6147,5,Must buy!,Its good in affordable price.

Built quality is average with plastic body. But again considering the price point, this is a good one."
6155,5,Worth every penny,"Initially I was confused between Boat and Infinity but then decided to go for this, although moto and some other good brands were available in the same range. It's a sub brand of JBL, even then there must be something... thinking of that went for this. But I was not wrong. Product is superb although bit bassy. Comfortable on ear.

6157,3,Nice,The product is not that comfortable my ears pain a little bit after 6-7 hours of wearing it (Though I don't think many of you would use it continuously for that long but just a heads up if you do) and the connectivity range is decent. The battery life is what amazed me and this thing lasts around 1¬Ω days. The sound quality is decent and is fairly loud but I would suggest to buy atleast 40mm drivers for a better experience.But the thing I suffer with is that in spite of having a Bluetooth 5.0...

6171,2,Expected a better product,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios.I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up.But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???"
6172,1,Hated it!,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience
6173,1,Terrible product,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me ü§¨
6174,1,Terrible product,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me, oppo, mivi, all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely"
6175,5,Excellent,NO WORDS..absolutely wonderful about the sound quality and vocal toning..bass is perfect all that you need..Has been using for a month now and it is working perfectly well. The connectivity is pretty impressive..The fit is perfect in ears and doesn't give pain after long hours.I was using MI Basic earphones for a year and switched into this and I think it was the best decision ever.Overall it is the perfect earpiece that u can have for enjoying uninterrupted songs and voice calls.
6176,4,Good choice,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ..."

6178,5,Fabulous!,"I just love this earphone. The sound quality is just awesome. The audio is pretty loud and decent, not harsh. The mic quality is also brilliant. It has Bluetooth 5.0. The connectivity is very easy. I can easily connect it with multiple devices. I like the music backup it almost lasts for 15 hr. Which is enough for my daily usage. I highly like this."
6179,5,Super!,"I recommended to all the buyer to go for this product only there are lots of brand in the market like noise, jbl, Realme boat and all but if your budget is 2000 then go for this item only you gona love it trust me. this is the long term review from my side and thanx me later."
6180,4,Value-for-money,"1. Call quality is Good. I have tested the call infront of high volume TV. The call was pretty good and didn't hear much noise if TV music. 4.5/52. Music is good. Bass is not as expected. But if you adjust the Equalizer, the Music is good. 4/5.3. Comfort is Pretty good. 5/5.4. Battery is also really good. 5/5."
6181,5,Highly recommended,"I've been using this product since last 6 months and i am excited to tell you that this product is worth the price. Its completely water resistant because once i was riding my bike through the city i had this headset worn my neck and it started raining and i was all set including the headset,i thought everything was over since water was everywhere and surpricingly everything works excellent when i connected again after reaching home.

6184,4,Good quality product,Some time audio can be disconnected...Change Audio tract is not working properly...I am so excited with battery life it's was really awesome...Audio and bass quality is not good but it ok...Worthy for this budget...If you need extra bass and extra audio don't choose it with my personal suggestion

6187,4,Good choice,"Rich clear sound , don't go for boat if you want a long term product , by spending 700 more get these , boat won't last long , if we tak about bass it's more and real in hd and 4k videos and normal in low quality video so bass depends on video quality ,saying by testing for 1hour straight from trailers to bass test to songs to movies... Just go it or if your budget is more just go for one plus earbuds for 3k but battery is still in testing mode charged full in 20-30min from 20%to 100 .."

6189,5,Wonderful,The quality of the headphone is awesome. Easy to connect to any mobile and PC. Sound quality and bass are satisfactory and worth every penny. Go for it!
6190,5,Super!,Simply outstandingReview after 5days of heavy usageFirst thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.
6191,5,Must buy!,Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.
6192,5,Worth every penny,I have used a lot of Bluetooth neckband earphones but after using OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition for a while now I can surely say that these are the best neckband earphones below 2000 rupees. Build quality is excellent. Material used is very premium. Sound quality is also top notch. Battery life is also very good. Very happy with this product.

6195,3,Just okay,"This is not a very good product as per brand value and its price bracket. People who have given very good rating perhaps not used any other earphone earlier. I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus. Investing almost 2k is not worth. It will better to go for boat.Guys one most important thing I wish to add here, please don't trust on YouTube vi..."

I have segregated my points:1. I took it for my office calls as it gives flexibility to move around during lengthy calls. The sound quality is very good. Crisp and clear voice.

6198,4,Good choice,"Should include switch button to switch between devices. The first time a used this, the sound quality was premium . earlier I was using boat rockerz 245. Yes there is bass to but for maximum effect you have to maximize the volume and you can't stay in this for long then . You Ave to adjust volume and equalisers. Magnetic on/off works very good ."
6199,5,Worth every penny,Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.
6200,4,Very Good,"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there.

6202,4,Pretty good,No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.
6203,4,Good quality product,"This is my second OnePlus Bullets bass edition. Before I used normal edition. I am very much satisfied with this. Best battery backup I got ever, it give 5 to 7 days of backup. Thanks for Best Latency for playing Pubg and other games. I suggest everyone to just try this for once. Thanks OnePlus Never Settle."
6204,4,Value-for-money,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage. So if you get chance to try it before you can buy than that would I prefer and recommend. Else you won't be able to enjoy it to full.
6205,5,Must buy!,"Too good... At last 1+ improved in sound dept. You can feel each and every single note and the most good thing is you can hear tempo in one bud and others in the 2nd bud. I mean, the surround sound sistem is too good"

6221,3,Does the job,"Bass is not that smooth nor a destroyer to the ears. It is a blend of decent bass.I dont like the bass performance but the overall make, fit and finish is good. Built Quality is good. The higher variant of the Oneplus Wireless Bullets 2 are way too good than this product in terms of sound and quality.At this price point of Rs. 1799, this is not the best product. It sounds like a Rs. 1000 product which are also available on flipkart with different branding."

One more additional thing is that it can be charged within 50 minutes to 100% and 10 minutes of charging gives more than 60% of charge.FINAL VERDICT : GO FOR IT BLINDLY"
6228,3,Good,The build quality is GoodCharging time and battery backup is excellent.The sound quality is good but the sound clarity is not like a Rs2000 earphone

6234,5,Wonderful,"Actually this is the earphones that once I dreamt of. Now I got this and I am really really was excited about this.The sound quality is so far the best in the segment and the reengineered bass is so sick.The battery pack up has no issues cause it supports warp charging, so 10 minutes is crazy fast. And the built quality has been always better with one plus.So I am fully satisfied"
6235,5,Highly recommended,Product is great. Gets charge quickly and last for long. Sound and built quality is best within this price range. Not recommended for gamers though as letency is high. Great for watching movies or listening to music. Only problem is in calling. I have to keep left on ear and on right side hanging as it brings mic closer to mouth so that other end can hear the call clearly. If not than other end often complains about not hearing my voice clearly while using this earphone.
6236,4,Wonderful,Sound quality is really good and build is decent. The buttons are just not that great to be honest. Battery life is 12-14 hrs only. Don't expect more than thisBut the most important thing sound is excellent and bass is also well balanced. Price to performance is decent not that great.
6237,5,Highly recommended,"This is very good headphone AFAIK. It takes only 10mins to charge 80% (any charger which supports quick charge can be used, i used my poco 18W charger) which is sufficient for 10hrs usage. It takes 1hr to reach 100% charge.Battery life is fantastic i got around 15 to 16hrs. Volume is too high so can't go over 50%. Build quality looks nice, feels sturdy and the cable is braided.

6238,5,Must buy!,The build quality of the earphone is very good sound is awsme bass is good enough it will not hurt your ear battery backup is awsme so overall product is very good
6239,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Sound quality is good, the bass thump is great! Instrument separation, sound clarity and soundstage is above average at this price point. The main highlight is the battery life. I have been using it for 2 weeks now, and it lasts around 15 hours on single full charge, and takes only 10 min to get charged to 70 80 % which indeed gives battery backup as claimed for 9 to 10 hrs. It also is somewhat on the comfortable side and very lightweight. Overall a great product considering the price point."
6240,5,Worth every penny,Awesome Quality Nice Sound & Bass I M Happy With This Product Thank You So Much One Plus & Flipkart
6241,3,Nice,"Good connectivity, battery backup and build quality. Sound quality is so average, definitely not as good as my boat rockers 255. Useful for office work, attending calls or listening to lectures. A big no for listening to music."
6242,5,Best in the market!,Battery backup is good. Charging speed also very fast. Not best but good sound quality. Worth for price. I am enjoying the product
6243,3,Decent product,Dont look only brand value. Good but not worthy for 1999. Go for any other like boat or something else.
6244,5,Awesome,Sound quality is decent bass is below average you don't expect bass like headphone. Best part about your earphone fast charging and battery backup just 15 minute charge and you're good to go for 10 to 12 hours

6246,4,Pretty good,The collar and wire quality is good. Battery back up is bang on I mean I'm using it in my day to day calls and videos and it easily work for 8-10 hours on heavy usage. One thing that is missing is quick switch. I'm using the OP buds as well and quick switch on them works like magic to switch between devices.
6247,5,Simply awesome,I have purchased OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition Red recently and it is very useful. Red Color looks very premium. Quality of the product is also very good. I am very satisfied with the service. And as always thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery of the product.

6249,3,Just okay,Good bluetooth earphones but price was high for middle class music lovers .bass was good for listinining.mic was not clear in running or at bike.battery back up was nice.earphone 100% not fit into ur ears exactly . totally my opinion sound quality and battery backup good .price comparison was too High .
6250,5,Super!,"Now from my experience, I searched for a lot of earphones and saw each and every one... What I found was this bass edition is better than most other wireless earphones though some reviews said that build quality is not good.. what I feel is.. sound quality, bass ... Very good! Very happy about it.. Connectivity is top notch... Easy to wear... No any ear pain during long hours of usage.. But battery back up... Its been 5 days now.. I have charged it only 2 twice.. 10 mins full 100%... Wow! One..."
6251,4,Good quality product,Fantastic system it has but not have bass. Sound quality is average. I would like to inform you that do not waste your money by seeing ONEPLUS tag. You can buy better Wireless Earphone at very cheap price of Boat. Sound quality good but no to appreciate!
6252,4,Value-for-money,good product in bass edition but bass is not comparable with boat...... decent bass available. boat bass is good than one plus . battery life is best. 10 min. of charging gives 10 hrs of playtime
6253,5,Worth every penny,Best and most lovable one. The true one plus brand. Go for it without doubt. I assure this
6254,3,Fair,"hello, If you're 1+ Bullets wireless Z Bass user mean... You can hear opponents voice very well even if you ride bike. But Opponents didn't hear your voice when u ride bike and in travelling. Otherwise it's one of the best in this price.. Bass is powerful and Good."
6255,4,Pretty good,"I am writting this review after 3 weeks of usage.Sound-First thing first if you like to hear just bass and don't care about anything else then don't buy this one, go for Boat or Realme, but if you are like me who likes well balance sound with decent base then i think this is the best headset for this price, bass is not overpowering nether its dull its just comes alive when you need it.Battery-Most people will be impressed by its fast changing, i charge it for 10 minutes and it gives me..."
6256,4,Value-for-money,"Writing this review after 6 months(almost) of use.As price is concern the sound quality is quite good must say, no lag in connection if the versions are updated. It can catch a good distance and gives a good battery backup as well as good sound also.No issue so far, if someone wants a good deal under 1200 ,i must say go for it when sale is around."

6258,4,Nice product,Its too much bass and somewhere it affects the quality of musicBut the battery is very good and im satisfied with batteryBut interms music quality i would prefer oppo enco m31
6259,5,Classy product,"I am very satisfied with this product, i got this one on 11 june morning, at that time 40 % charge used at today eve, at that time below 10 % so good battery back up, sound and bass vry good, i think this is the updated version,any way i am satisfied till now"
6260,5,Must buy!,"I am happy with the product I received. Packed tightly and got genuine product.This is after 10days review.I charged for 3time only- battery backup really niceNo irritation at all while placingThere is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving personSounds are really amazingI will re edit again after 20daysDesign, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.Nice one... Good ..."
6261,2,Expected a better product,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios.I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up.But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???"
6262,1,Hated it!,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience
6263,1,Terrible product,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me ü§¨
6264,1,Terrible product,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me, oppo, mivi, all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely"
6265,5,Excellent,NO WORDS..absolutely wonderful about the sound quality and vocal toning..bass is perfect all that you need..Has been using for a month now and it is working perfectly well. The connectivity is pretty impressive..The fit is perfect in ears and doesn't give pain after long hours.I was using MI Basic earphones for a year and switched into this and I think it was the best decision ever.Overall it is the perfect earpiece that u can have for enjoying uninterrupted songs and voice calls.
6266,4,Good choice,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ..."
6267,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Before purchasing I was so nervous about it. But now i bet no else wireless earphone can compete it....

6268,5,Fabulous!,"I just love this earphone. The sound quality is just awesome. The audio is pretty loud and decent, not harsh. The mic quality is also brilliant. It has Bluetooth 5.0. The connectivity is very easy. I can easily connect it with multiple devices. I like the music backup it almost lasts for 15 hr. Which is enough for my daily usage. I highly like this."
6269,5,Super!,"I recommended to all the buyer to go for this product only there are lots of brand in the market like noise, jbl, Realme boat and all but if your budget is 2000 then go for this item only you gona love it trust me. this is the long term review from my side and thanx me later."
6270,4,Pretty good,Fabulous in this range..1. Sound quality is very good2. Premium built quality and look.. from inside it may feel like plastic3. Battery backup is good..4. If you love bass the don't go for it..5. It doesn't block your ear.. you can hear surrounding voice while using it
6271,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I hope you guys find this review helpful, well it's too soon for a review but I think it's worth every penny,Sound - Do not have high expectations for bass atleast, rest of the sound is amazing, you get a clear voice even if it turns a bit windy on roads, songs when played have a clear voice, good for casual song listening, you can watch movies and browse, sound is good even when you play games on phone.Battery backup - is amazing, I've been using it the whole day, as soon as you put the..."

6275,5,Brilliant,Nice colour nd too cute sound quality is good hope it works well
6276,4,Nice product,"Very good option at this pricePros: Build quality, clear sound, Lightweight, branded product at low price, perfect fitting, insta wake up technology Good bass and sound(by using other music players mentioned below)Cons: Low bass which can control by other music players like Google play music, Dub music player or third party equaliser app. You will get perfect sound by playing music on this players."
6277,5,Great product,Satisfying . Received today morning. Continuously using this earpods for 3 hrs and still battery is at 90% . So all good. Base can be better but good at this price. Good at calling also. I can hear voice while riding and that's really good. Overall worth buying.
6278,5,Wonderful,First thanks to flipkart for super fast delivery.Boat has brought great airdopes in such a affordable price.Sound quality is good .Light weight .Good colors.Bass could have been better.Overall great product from Made in India Brand Boat.
6279,5,Worth every penny,This price segment this is pretty good and love this boat product and sound quality is average bad battery backup is super I love this airdops
6280,5,Great product,"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price, THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkartüòçüòç"
6281,4,Delightful,Good product with fine looks.Bass is not super good but it is ok u can feel beats.connectivity is good overall product is good but one thing hurts me is that it is not waterproof üò≠ and this is a issue for me rest I am happy because it's design is pretty cool . I had already one plus wireless earphone but whenever I use it it's neck wire irritates meüòÇ
6282,5,Excellent,Loved the sound quality loved the base and the bild quality is awesome üëçüëçüëçüëç I love it plzzz go for it best airpods in this price buy it right now n for pubg also best it is üî•üî•üëçüëç
6283,4,Worth the money,Bass is not upto the mark. Sound quality is excellent. Cryastal clear sound. Boat should improve the bass quality in this airdopes. Boats other headphones having best bass .overall it's good and value for money.
6284,3,Nice,OkUpdated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.
6285,4,Very Good,"I ordered the product in the sale on 22nd Aug & immediately received it on the morning of 23rd Aug.I must say at this price point the product is quite good.Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is."
6286,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst product ever bought. Instead, you can go and try for ""Flipkart smartbuy bass beatz"". A very decent earphones in very reasonable price. Never go for boat airdopes 131 as this is just good in look and WORST in performance. Could have given 0 star if available in option."
6287,1,Worst experience ever!,"Not at all for bass lover. The music just seems to be soft nor is it loud, there's no loudness at all. According to the price it should've been a bit more worth it building up the bass & for bass lovers there's no bass at all. Giving an honest review from the day of purchase & delivered."
6288,1,Hated it!,Although design is gud in look but the sound quality is cheapest...not only cheapest...its too cheapest and annoying...üò£Not satisfied at this price... Boat rockerzz 255 is too much better then these eardopes at this price rate...üëéüëéüëéI have boat eardopes 281 which is also very good in sound and design...

Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...Just go for it"

6300,4,Value-for-money,"The earphone got delivered in 1 day. Speaking of sound quality the sound is good you get decent amount of base for the price. The design though is not upto the mark you cannot wear it for prolonged hours as it gets uncomfortable. The microphone is ok calling experience is ok not that great. Battery backups i cannot comment on that as I haven‚Äôt used it a lot. But for the price that you are paying ,this thing is totally worth the buy."

6302,5,Fabulous!,"It's nice overall mainly because of the low price. It has pressable button towards the outer part by pressing which one can receive/reject call, play/pause music.

Its just the product quality should have been a bit more high because it will get scratches on the go.. One thing is that you cannot hold it for longer as the ear start paining. short duration is ok to use.

6336,3,Decent product,"I wish to point out one very basic thing the earbuds are designed well but the material used for covering the sound outlet is no good it in good brands its steel or metal based very fine mesh, in this case it just came out to be nothing but a cloth based thin layer pasted with low quality glue. Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore."

6340,5,Best in the market!,"I am a bit skeptical about buying electronics online. But thanks to the seller I have got a good shopping experience. I don't know much about bass or everything. But it has good build smooth sound, received a perfect product."
6341,4,Pretty good,"All are excellent but it is not connected well with Microsoft Teams call because in other end can't hear properly, so unable to use it for official call. But if you're using only with mobile then it's too good without any doubt. Additionally, it won't block your ear hole fully so you'll get enough ventilation for your ear which eliminate ear problems."
6342,4,Good choice,See this is like the best u can get in 1299 there is just one problem u see when unbox and connect for first time only one get connected u have to factory reset to that part is hilarious I was shocked first then I made it correct and bass and sound should be improved
6343,5,Simply awesome,This pair of headset is perfectly fine and worth every penny. The sound quality is absolutely clear with defined bass. Mic works perfectly fine. Also perfectly suitable for people who wear earphones during driving. Though it is risky but still works absolutely good. Battery is good. Perfect airdopes at reasonable price.

6348,5,Fabulous!,"Bass quality should be better,But in this price range its goodBattery backup is greatCall quality is excelentIn simple words those are Good Duo pods"
6349,3,Decent product,Charging and look are good but sound is bad sound of right eardopes are very less compare to left one and bass is also nice but fitting in ear is good but after some times it will pain.Overall I give it 3/5.
6350,5,Simply awesome,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it.3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look."
6351,4,Wonderful,"Sound quality is above average and bass is low , design and look is amazing. At this price range it is a great deal . If you are a good music lover do not go for this, for call purposes it is good."
6352,5,Great product,"I using these Headset for last 2 days. The experience with my Boat Airpods 131 Bluetooth Headset is nice. But the price (Rs-1,299)of the product is very costly. We can expect many things for these price from other brand. When we come with brand we want to sacrifice the price.Probs:1) Very good design and build for these prize2) Bluetooth connectivity is Awesome3) Type - C Port for charging the headset is good.4) 1 year warranty5) Battery backup is upto the markCons:1) Bass of the ear..."

6364,5,Best in the market!,Superb worthy product üòä I Love it thank you flipcart
6365,4,Wonderful,Overall A Very Good Product on BudgetSound Quality could be a little more better but can't complain much for a budget device like this. Very easy to pair and setup and excellent battery life. As all always after sale service by Boat is EXCELLENT.
6366,5,Best in the market!,Good product good sound quality and good battery backup best price and best valuable item
6367,5,Just wow!,Best product but bass is less battery is also best design is also best and sound quality is also best but bass is less
6368,4,Wonderful,"Some of the reviews here are overrated.- The battery backup is really nice.- No compatibility problems, however it doesn't support AAC sound attributes in some devices.- One of my Pods has excellent bass, the other one's okay.- Mono pod feature works well- You can't control the volume with these, it has to be controlled by device you're connected to.Probably the best you can get for 1300 INR"
6369,5,Brilliant,Best earbuds in range of 2500 or i can say in 3000.... Backup voice quality both excellent instant pairing is best
6370,5,Great product,"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price, THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkartüòçüòç"
6371,4,Delightful,Good product with fine looks.Bass is not super good but it is ok u can feel beats.connectivity is good overall product is good but one thing hurts me is that it is not waterproof üò≠ and this is a issue for me rest I am happy because it's design is pretty cool . I had already one plus wireless earphone but whenever I use it it's neck wire irritates meüòÇ
6372,5,Excellent,Loved the sound quality loved the base and the bild quality is awesome üëçüëçüëçüëç I love it plzzz go for it best airpods in this price buy it right now n for pubg also best it is üî•üî•üëçüëç
6373,4,Worth the money,Bass is not upto the mark. Sound quality is excellent. Cryastal clear sound. Boat should improve the bass quality in this airdopes. Boats other headphones having best bass .overall it's good and value for money.
6374,3,Nice,OkUpdated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.
6375,4,Very Good,"I ordered the product in the sale on 22nd Aug & immediately received it on the morning of 23rd Aug.I must say at this price point the product is quite good.Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is."
6376,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst product ever bought. Instead, you can go and try for ""Flipkart smartbuy bass beatz"". A very decent earphones in very reasonable price. Never go for boat airdopes 131 as this is just good in look and WORST in performance. Could have given 0 star if available in option."
6377,1,Worst experience ever!,"Not at all for bass lover. The music just seems to be soft nor is it loud, there's no loudness at all. According to the price it should've been a bit more worth it building up the bass & for bass lovers there's no bass at all. Giving an honest review from the day of purchase & delivered."
6378,1,Hated it!,Although design is gud in look but the sound quality is cheapest...not only cheapest...its too cheapest and annoying...üò£Not satisfied at this price... Boat rockerzz 255 is too much better then these eardopes at this price rate...üëéüëéüëéI have boat eardopes 281 which is also very good in sound and design...
6379,5,Worth every penny,"And yes there you go...You have the best in-budget tws....First of all, let me get something straight- It has amazing sound qualityA decent bassA nice battery backupBut it lacks only in built design. Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...Just go for it"
6380,5,Perfect product!,I am very happy with this product. The U&I Titanic series sports neckband is just awesome. The sound and bass is too good. It has also very good battery life and I haven't charged it since 3 days and more to go. It is comfortable to wear and has perfect sound quality. I had an excellent experience of this neckband. It is also economical. A must buy for all.
6381,5,Excellent,Great experience... awesome sounds quality.. noise reduction .very much comfortable in ears .. awesome build quality .stylish look that makes it different from other brand . happy...Good packing on this price range...
6382,5,Best Bluetooth headphones for the price,"I literally use my bluetooth headsets all day long, for almost every purpose. I run and skate several times weekly, and use my headset for business calls etc.///I've had many ""around the neck"" bluetooth headsets, this by far seems to be the best!Super easy instructions, at initial power on, it goes automatically into pairing mode. The answer/accept/decline is GREAT!Definately worth the money. (And I almost never say that!!!)///Positive:- The sound quality and product product quality..."

This looks like premium made and quality. And it's for a great value, Recommended to buy."

7020,5,Perfect product!,I have purchased a lot of buds but these are no. 1 in sound and bass quality along with good looks and i personally love white colour for earbuds so i purchased them and best thing is they are Made in India. Overall happy with the buds.
7021,3,Nice,"The battery is all over okay, but if you have sensitive ears this product is not for you.... My ears starts paining after 10 minutes of use, the sound quality is good and fitting size is also good"
7022,4,Delightful,"The product is very good, but the sound is not good enough to satisfy me, design and feature are very good."
7023,5,Amazing Earbuds!,Mivi Duopods F3042 hours battery Fast Charging is the best budget TWS Bluetooth Earbuds from Mivi.*Sound quality is good if listen at 70 to 80% at 100% then its a little noisy.*The quality of the case is low.*Easy to pair in just 5 seconds.*Battery backup is powerful as it can last 10 t0 12 hours on a single charge.* You can use single bud.*The touch controls are good and it responds quickly.
7024,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I must say, I am impressed by the quality and sound of the tws, didn't expect them to be good for this price, I do already have a Samsung galaxy buds+, compared to that this one does have a better sound quality and jabra's fit a bit better than Samsung, but to be fair I wish we had a better EQ setting for the jabra other than that the missing features do make up for the sound quality considering Samsung doesn't support aptx and also Samsung doesn't have a good water resistance rating, IPX2 VS..."
7025,5,Worth every penny,I like this Duopods very much. The Sound Quality and Bass of this Duopods are awesome. The battery backup is long laster i.e. 42 hours. It doesn't have any button. It has a great feature that I like very much is Auto Charging. When I put this Duopods in case they charge automatically and I used to get full charge next time. I don't like the design of this Duopods. The design is so simple with mate finish.

7383,5,Must buy!,Really it's amazing product.....I am really happy with mic quality and battery backup....... for those will receive more calls this is the best product to choose....
7384,1,Terrible product,"Average product , sound is to loud , you can't enjoy bass. Battery and build quality is not bad.Never recommend for music Lovers. In this price segment you get other good products with good sound quality."
7385,1,Absolute rubbish!,There is no bass in this earphone so if you prefer to listen music with high bass earphones then you'll regret. Also there is a promotion strategy going on with this product which most of you all don't know whereby you'll get a movie ticket voucher by giving high ratings and positive reviews on flipkart from the Boult company. So all of the postive reviews that you'll find for this product is not trustworthy and the people giving those reviews also got duped and now they want to dupe others a...
7386,4,Good quality product,I get it yesterday and i m using it continually after purchase its battery backup is so nice sound is good and nice base. I bought it only 999 in flipkart sale and i wannna say it is good bluetooth headset in 999
7387,1,Hated it!,"My friend had same model but to my surprise the one i bought didn't have many features like vibration & bass. Voice and build quality is also not as good as the one with my friend.How can a company sell two products with same model name?Please check before buying. if its the one with the vibrator, its a good one."
7388,5,Perfect product!,one of the best Bluetooth earphone I liked it the best in this price point no connectivity issue calling quality good bass medium treble goodit has a great battery backup it gives a backup upto 8-9 hrsI will give update soon
7389,5,Must buy!,"Awesome Experience. Worth Price. Suggested to all. Awesome quality. 15-20 persons in my close friends, colleagues and family members are using this earphone. All are rated 5* to this product. Highly Appreciable."
7390,5,Terrific purchase,A sturdy product at a very reasonable price. No compromise on sound quality. Deep base and powerful magnets to keep earpbuds in place. I can personally pay a little more to have active nose cancellation which will make it a flawless product.
7391,3,Just okay,Honest Feedback !!!please don't buy them if u r a True Bass lover ! Even 600 rupees earphones of JBL give better bass than these. Being a bass lover I'm little bit dissapointed and feeling misguided by many Reviews here. Now i'm using them by keeping custom equilizer but can't work on youtube and other video songs.
7392,5,Highly recommended,I got little better than I expect.... sound quality is very nice quality is awesome basis ok.... overall this is a value for money product

So here goesPros1 .. great sound quality ( refined, doesn't feel like an echo or sound being played too close to the ear)2... passive sound blocker ( 40% of sounds are blocked when nothing is being played on the device)3...

7398,2,Bad quality,"Dont purchase this product.. all rating that giving just for free movie ticket which include in the box. Worst products, I purchased Boult curve on Flipkart but received broken earphone, later it got replaced. Now coming to the sound quality first thing is there is no such thing like deep bass and woofer. Even after using equilizer there is a very slight difference in bass after boosting 50 to 200hz and 200 to 500hz to 9db and 6 db. Connects to the phone instantly like other devices but you..."

I really recommend this product to all those bass lovers who is looking for a budget bluetooth earphones with thumping bass. Overall a perfect budget bluetooth earphones to buy.Thank you Boult Audio for the wonderfull product and thank you Flipkart for the amazing offer.
7401,4,Nice product,I'm using this product since from few months. I would like to say that Boult brand is better than that compare to other brand like sound bass and clarity vice..... I love to using this product... My overall rating is 4.5
7402,4,Very Good,It was awesome i have a good experience. Its too good. I used so many headphones. But particularly boult audio was awesome. Like design and bass quality superb. Thank u so much.
7403,2,Could be way better,well I bought it in the Flipkart big billion days and it's definitely a worthy product for 9 months at max. bass is upto the point mic is great. design is not so upto the mark but battery backup is damn good. These things are only good until 9 months. Its been 9 months and today my headphone stopped working. If you want a long lasting product then go for some worthy product like boat or one plus.
7404,2,Moderate,This product is waste for bass lovers.... Treble sounds good ...Audio clarity was nice ...Bass lovers need to go for boat for better bass
7405,5,Terrific,"Simply Amazing! Very nice product. The design & built quality is too good. Magnetic earbuds are best part. Sound quality & battery life is also Better than other bluetooth headsets. Buy it without any doubt, you'll definitely like itüòòüòç"
7406,5,Classy product,"This product has excellent call clarity, ergonomically comfortable and handy design and a perfect price point. At this cost this is probably the best Bluetooth headset available in the market. Additional benefit is the bass that is offers so it does not compensate on your music experience, rather it enhance it. Battery life is above average. Overall a multi bagger package. Must have product."
7407,3,Just okay,"Ok for taking calls. But this cannot be an ideal device for listening music because sound is mediocre. Not sure why it is advertised as ProBass wherein I feel the treble is boosted rather than bass. Ear bud fails to obstruct outside noise while listening.Good thing about this product: Built quality, looks good and good battery back-up.When I purchased this product then I didn't had much expectation on sound quality as I only intended to use it for taking calls. if you have similar requirem..."

7417,2,Moderate,Boult audio probass is really amazing item.when I was Shw it I am schock .sound quality& bass is outstanding... everything is perfectly created...

7431,5,Mind-blowing purchase,It is my first neckband and to be honest i liked the product overall. The ANC is good for the price dont expect miracle but its good for sounds like fan noise etc. The sound quality is good and the bass is also nice. I can see there are many reviews with 1 and 2 stars given because of the audio/video sync issue but to update the issue has been totally resolved with a firmware update given by realme through realme link app. The firmware update number is 1.1.0.56. Hope this helps.

7458,5,Super!,"Sound was as expected with 13 mm drivers was awesome. Build quality was good enough and instant pairing was blazing. Only drawback was while wearing for couple of hours neck was painful and lot of discomfort. Another important thing is we can't fold and put in pocket if you want. I need that feature, but missing in it. But by experiencing build quality and sound quality, I kept aside these drawbacks. Over all awesome product by Realme."
7459,4,Delightful,Well the sound quality is great in a room but during travel it is not that good.realme claim that its battery backup is 22hr but it gives only 10hr - 11hr of battery life.( with ANC and LDAC off and earphone volume at 40%)automatically its pause the music which is very irritating.earlier i have the first version of realme buds wireless earphone which is far far better than this version as compared to every factors.i will suggest everyone to buy the old version not this one.

7467,5,Just wow!,Important- The audio video synchronisation issue is now corrected with an update.The noise cancellation is Good for this device. Use bass mode only when you are listening to bass driven songs otherwise prefer dynamic mode. The sound quality is pretty good. The build quality is also nice. Feels lightweight. A suggested buy.
7468,4,Value-for-money,"Good product but should consider the comfort..... Features are overloaded compared to price, but not that comfortable when using for longer duration, like if you are gonna use it for around a hour that be of no issue.. but if using for around 2 hours continuously then they are little heavier on housing and buds.

Following are pros and cons I have observedPros -Sound quality is good at this price pointANC works well during virtual & voice callsBuild quality is decentCons -Dual pairing mode is missingBluetooth Connectivity range is slightly compromised if you walk away from the connected deviceBattery backup is not as good as it was on their earlier modelOverall product is decent and values for ..."
7470,5,Awesome,I like everything about it.. Sound is superb design and built quality is also very good..But there is just one flaw... It takes about 10sec to reconnect once u take the magnetic buds apart.. My other neckbands are faster compared to it
7471,4,Wonderful,"Overall gud....Gaming mode is gud... Low latency compared to other wireless.Bass is ok. Treble reduction is not good in bass mode.Nice build, LDAC MODE is dope.. You have to go to bluetooth settings and have to turn on LDAC MODE EACH TIME..Cant experience QUALITY music like these even in airpods.Its a worth buy. Stereo while gaming is good. You can spot your enemy like a pro."
7472,4,Wonderful,"PROS :(1) Awesome battery life, specially when LDAC is turned off. 99% of the music we listen, are not that hi-res. So we don't need LDAC actually.(2) ANC and transparent modes are BEASTS : both works super awesomely.(3) Realme Link app equalizer is mind - blowing : Specially the dynamic and bright modes are super cool. Unless you are a deep, headache - causing - bass lover, bright mode gives what we actually want, pretty good bass with balanced sound.(4) Fitting is good, though it may fe..."
7473,4,Good quality product,Simple review :1. bass is not so good but ok2. noice cancellation is nice3. gaming mode is waste4. gaming mode connectivity is poor some time it's voice go out and some time it's come5. battery backup is good6. Overall good buds in this prize rangeNote :-If you buy this for 2200 not buy this at time wait for prize drop ..I am buying this buds 1500 Flipkart big billion day ... Or if you want more perfection wait for one Plus new addition it's coming soon üôÇüôÇ tx
7474,5,Worth every penny,"I have used these little monsters for 15 days now..and only thing I wanna say is they simply amazing. Here's the detailed review, if that's helpful for you guys in any ways..Pros:1) I had used wired realme earphones for sometime and value for money was written in every nooks and corner. Later I bought sony XB 400 for comparitivily higher price. I kid you not, I found these better than sony ( sorry sony..I am your die hard fan but this is an honest confession.)2) active noise cancellation w..."
7475,4,Nice product,"Decent one for the money. I probably was expecting too much from them. Sound quality doesn't seem better than even OnePlus Bullets Wireless 1st gen. Though the 1st gen Bullets had great sound anyway. Bass of the Realmes is better though. ANC works, it isn't too much, but it still feels lovely to use. Same with transparent mode.So, like I said at the start, for 1999/2299 it's very good but don't expect exceptional sound quality.PS: The sound too is fairly low. Need to play at least at 80% fo..."
7476,1,Did not meet expectations,"1. As per the Add description , get normal sound only not more.2. The deep bass work , based on the bass booster application and not good bass for as per 13.6 mm driver.3. The making design not fit in left ear me and my two friends. it's fit right side ear only.4. Finally realme buds wireless -1 is best compare to realme buds wireless-2."
7477,5,Best in the market!,"Really liked, but the wire is little long and earbud not fitting properly. Need some improvement there , liked the connectivity. Type c charging is good.Noise cancellation is okay and normal mode is good.Bass boost is good"
7478,5,Highly recommended,Wireless 2i have purchased realme Buds Wireless 2 and its a fantastic neckband with 12mm bass boost driver and its low latency is very fine. i have enjoyed my gaming very well with realme Buds Wireless 2MOHD Ehtisham
7479,5,Great product,"I bought the grey variant....This is my first bluetooth earphones.I had been using Realme buds 2 (excellent build quality, sound and bass is awesome in that)I was really anxious about the sound quality on Realme buds wireless 2, whether it performs well as the wired one, or not.Coming to Realme buds wireless 2, üëáüèªüî∏ Looks are cool.üî∏ In hand feel is very good, soft and light weight (doesn't even know that you are wearing this after some time).....üî∏ Very comfortable....üî∏ Good ..."
7480,5,Brilliant,"ANC- Working perfectly.tried it In traffic and I felt like I'm at some plase so quiet.Sound Quality- Top Notch. LDAC working fine.Transparent Mode- working fine but it will take some time to get used to it. Perfect to listen to others without removing headset or for riding bike. I needed a headset which won't obstruct traffic sound, like horns and other vehicles sounds for safety and be attendive at road. I used to use normal on-ear headset for that purpose but this headset is much bett..."
7481,5,Highly recommended,"Best sounding earphones in this category purchased ""oneplus bullet wireless z base edition"" earlier but i faced noise issue in that so i purchased this and it worth it and best price to performance ratio .. noise cancellation works very good for this price .. sound quality is excellent bass are punchy and clear + music separation are excellent. one issue is about the range i feel range of this earphone is less than oneplus earphones . but most important i want sound quality and functions li..."
7482,5,Best in the market!,"it's value for money product better than OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition really it's great experience great bass, sound, loudness, battery backup and most important build quality is superb."
7483,5,Highly recommended,Every thing is fine just battery drain faster than mentioned normal usage with LDAC off is last around 12 hours and thats tha maximum i saw with LDAC on it last around 6-7hours which is pretty bad. Backup is not as good as mentioned but it charges very quickly and sound is really impressive
7484,4,Very Good,"Noise drops for 1 or 2 seconds even after second 1.1.0.58 update, needs to be addressed with LDAC codec. ANC is ok. VOCPLUS AI is fabulous and overall product is extremely good and I found within 26 minutes charges full on power bank and shuts off, 35 minutes on direct charger supply. Initially I finalised to return but overall great package and decided to keep."
7485,4,Nice product,"While using bass or dynamic mode treble becomes low and in bright mode its good. Sometimes there is lag in sound. Ldac is like a gimmick its only for advertisement don't work ,you would not make difference in aac & ldac in this .They don't provide crispy sound like akg earphone( one of my favourite), but over all its good at this price point.."
7486,5,Wonderful,If you are worrying about its bass then dont worry cause it's realme link app have three option like 1. Bass boost2. Dynamic 3. Bright if you love bass then connect your hdphn with realme link and then choose bass boost option it will increase bass then u will realise that you are listening song from a home theatre its bass just amazing
7487,5,Fabulous!,Really good product with nice features and sound quality. Base is soft but high quality. Wish base was little more punchier. But overall excellent purchase.
7488,4,Pretty good,Bass is too heavy sometimes overall good sound quality lil over priced buds are too big due to big drivers.neckband is light and holds good while workout battery backup is good ANC is ok oke transparency mode is useful for street use don't know about durability but cable feels good love the shiny part on buds
7489,5,Highly recommended,Item arrived very fast. Cheers to Ekart.I had used the Realme Buds Wireless previously.Compared to that the buds wireless 2 has lengthier wires.It has a dedicated on off switch.The buttons are very clickable compared to the previous versionBattery charges fast as this one has got dart charging. and the backup also seems to be excellent.The settings can be changed via the Realme link app.It upgraded the firmware as soon as I connected. That is a positive indication that the comp...
7490,5,Terrific,It's active noise cancellation work very well (it's can cancel more than 75% noise) and no words for sounds quality .. it's too best 5 out 5Great work by realme .. keep moving and keep doing
7491,5,Super!,Go for it!!I have tested it for 2 days now since delivery and trust me I got the first experience of what ANC is ! It really works.Sound quality is top notch as well as battery life!Get it before it goes out of stock
7492,5,Worth every penny,Really loved it.Basic things i love the most in these earphones1.sound quality better when compared to other brand which were available in the same price range.and i previously used boult earphones.2.Charging - Really fast when you use the prefect adopter so very quickly it will get charge3.Strength - Very sturdy and flexible4.Noise cancellation good when u switch on the mode5.Very cleary my friends getting my voice when surroundings also having disturbance coz he complained about one pl...
7493,3,Fair,It's an average headphone with high bass only but background doesn't sound clear like OnePlus battery is good I suggest go for OnePlus better then this
7494,1,Did not meet expectations,I'm not satisfied with service you take too much time to deliver this product....your Flipkart service is not good ... please improve it ..But overall product is good ... everything is good expect battery life......coz... company claim 22 hrs back-up but it give only 15-16 hrs.
7495,5,Fabulous!,Best value for money. There are better neckbands available in the market. But the kind of features it provides for 2k are worth praising. ANC can be felt. Do not expect ANC to be as good as a sony or bose or an apple product. You pay a premium for those. Multi device toggling is a useful feature when you have to attend office calls via lappie as well as phone.
7496,4,Really Nice,"Audio quality is good ..but mic audio isn't that good . It feels like you're talking from a distance and very less volume . So if you're planning to use this neckband for making calls more often then give it a skip , otherwise this is a very good product and worth the money spent . Battery backup, charging speed and Google fast pair all goodCons- mic audio quality"
7497,4,Good quality product,I buy realme bluetooth earbuds .After use 5days my ear are pain.And so comfortable.So I'm return my product.And after few days these ear phones are Lunched üòä.I buy it.It's so comfortable ü•∞.So good backup charge.And bild quality.Only this is medium base.Overall value for money.U want just in try this u really love it.U want more base than go for OnePlus..But it's so good.10 min charge 12 hours paly time this is so good.
7498,5,Terrific purchase,Really Overall good product with high and good sound quality and LDAC and ANC features at this price are top notchBuild quality excellentBattery backup around 15- 18 hrs with LDAC featureFast charging and moreover a best product at this priceCONSOnly thing I didn't like a bit id it's earbuds has not a better angle elevation due to which you may feel pain in ears after constant use for 5-8 hrs
7499,5,Classy product,Nice product at this price rangeSound quality is nice but at high volume there is slight disturbance but the bass drivers are up to the mark.The battery backup overall is nice and it changes as the mode such asNoise cancellation-14hrsNormal-18hrsTransparency-21hrsAnd in gaming mode LDAC cannot be worked but it is not a big problemActive noise cancellation is so good and design quality also nice.Overall it is good to buy it
7500,5,Fabulous!,"Feature rich neck band. Awesome quality. Sound is too loud and clear. The purpose of purchase is truly justified. People who have complaints about product can never be satisfied, come what may!!! Though am not a great fan of any specific brand but in real sense, Realme has well designed this product with good amount of R&D... Compliment for the product with 5Star and if you have adequate budget One must buy blindly with complete trust and faith."
7501,4,good my rating is 8.5/10,my rating will be 8.5comfort is better in oneplus and other than that everything is good in these.these are a little bit heavy compared to oneplus but noise cancellation is good and sound is also good
7502,5,Best in the market!,"After 1 month usage here is the review, 1st bad thing is maid in chaina and designed in chaina, Sound quality is very good, bass is out standing, build quality is very good.. but the magnetics are bit weak is not that much strong, and the device to device shifting is very awesome, but some times very delay to connect after the firmware updates, Noise cancellation is awesome when you are in room and office but not in public transport, still we can hear bus and car horns, (I think it is better..."

7504,4,Nice product,"I had been waiting for an upgrade to the realme wireless buds as I did not like the battery back up if it. So purchased this realme buds wireless 2 as soon as it was launched looking at the battery backup.But honestly, not impressed at all. It is a lot better that the last year variant but still disappointing considering the competition.Pros:-1. ANC - Decent for the price range2. Bass - Good for bass lovers. I'm not one, do never will use the bass boost. Only tested and it was pretty good..."
7505,4,Pretty good,Overall product is good but when I compared these to my old One plus bullet it falls short in a couple of areas.CONS1. Connection is not as fast as compared to one plus bullets.2. Unable to switch between two phones not sure if it works.Pros1. One area where it is superior as compared to one plus is sound.I am using it mostly for phone calls and would recommend one plus bullets (the old one with a switch button) if your primary reason for buying to take phone calls. If music is the ...

7507,5,Awesome,Best one . Best bassThe sound is amazing . The battery backup is up to 2 days and even the charging speed good it take 20to30 minutes to full charge in vooc charger . And I am fully satisfied . I love this buds . And the bass is extraordinary . 13.6 mm driver's . Totally value for money .
7508,3,Does the job,1. Sound quality is ok ok. Equalizer is not available in realme app so you cant customize it. Sound at full volume feel low. It has 13 mm drivers but it not producing that quality of sound.2. ANC is just for name. Even after activating anc you can listen person setting besides you. It is useless in bus or any public transport.3. Multi device connection - In this it is actually not getting connected multiple devices simultaneously. It just disconnecting from one device and getting connected ...
7509,3,Fair,Sound is not clear like OnePlus wireless z. Features are amazing in this neckband. Bass is awesome. But sound quality is not good.
7510,4,Nice product,"I really loved this productThe main feature i like is when we just separate the magnet the neckband will automatically connect to the mobile after pairing for the first time.Calling i tested noise cancelation, aww my god, can't even hear fan's sound and nothing hearable what is happening outside.Then this neckband is worth buying as it has main important two features - 88ms low latency and 13.6mm bass boost driversAnd one more special feature is that all realme neckband those who..."

7515,5,Just wow!,"Super ,lightweight and awsome bass ,3x better than oneplus z bass edition, so happy,this is my first realme product"
7516,5,Great product,"Everything is wonderful in these pair of headphones, audio quality, richness, bass, call quality, battery backup, all are very good at this price except one major issue. There's a audio and video sync problem, if u play videos then you will notice that the audio and video are not in a sync."
7517,1,Did not meet expectations,Everything is good but its designed very poorlyYou will not be able to forget the pain in your ears.After one day of use with discomfort it started pain in my earsAnd due to only replacement facility available you can't do anything ..I suggest you should try it first than only buy it.
7518,5,Terrific purchase,First of all thanks to Flipkart for quick delivery.I ordered on 26th noon and recieved on 28th morning and I from not from metro city but tier 2 city of Rajasthan.I have tested the neckband and here are my initial expressions as of now.Sound Quality 10/10Built Quality 10/10Packaging 10/10Call Quality 9.5/10Battery backup - it's just 24hr so I haven't tested it fully.

7520,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Writing this review after using it for more than 1 day. This is just a first impression of this product not a full review.1. The build quality is very good and solid. But the capsules are made of plastic unlike the metal used in previous generation.2. The design is also good and the earbuds are quite comfortable in the ears.3. Sound quality is best in this segment. Better then oneplus bullets wireless z bass edition.4. Battery backup is quite good. Need to test more.5. ANC is working fla...
7521,5,Mind-blowing purchase,It is my first neckband and to be honest i liked the product overall. The ANC is good for the price dont expect miracle but its good for sounds like fan noise etc. The sound quality is good and the bass is also nice. I can see there are many reviews with 1 and 2 stars given because of the audio/video sync issue but to update the issue has been totally resolved with a firmware update given by realme through realme link app. The firmware update number is 1.1.0.56. Hope this helps.
7522,5,Brilliant,"Update after 3 days usage:- Sound quality is better than previous version and bass is pretty good, noise cancellation works pretty good as it cancel upto 25db only. You can customise the options through realme link app.*There was sync issue with video which is fixed after a firmware update of earphones through realme link app now there is no issue.*Battery backup is not upto mark as on 50% volume i used for around 12-13 hours and ANC was on for around 3-4 hours in that.

7523,3,Does the job,"Music - GreatCalling - Great.ANC - Okay. Some people have hearing issue due to these. ANC is not a good idea Health wise. (This feature is way overrated. More than 95% people literally wont use it, cause it causes Migraines and severe headaches.).ENC - Okay.Comfort - Thats where biggest problem is. Its very very worse.NOTE : Ear pains are there in all Realme Earphones. And IDK why Realme is not upgrading that. Oneplus Z has longer earpiece which gives comfort and sits perfectly inside ..."

Sound Quality:The drivers definitely produce a very balanced sound that is surely going to satisfy most of the people including me.

7649,5,Must buy!,This review i was posted after 1 week using this 1+ bass editions neckband. It's sound quality is awesome bass effect also awesome then call audio quality also super when i receive this project it was 100% changed i was used more then 4 days in this neckband using audio and video player per day i am used 3 hrs approximately after 4 days i got 40% of remaining charger. i changed this neckband with in 10 minutes its fully charged. its worth for money.

Packed tightly and got genuine product.This is after 10days review.I charged for 3time only- battery backup really niceNo irritation at all while placingThere is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving personSounds are really amazingI will re edit again after 20daysDesign, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.Nice one... Good ..."
7651,2,Expected a better product,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios.I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up.But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???"
7652,1,Hated it!,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience
7653,1,Terrible product,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me ü§¨
7654,1,Terrible product,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me, oppo, mivi, all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely"
7655,5,Excellent,NO WORDS..absolutely wonderful about the sound quality and vocal toning..bass is perfect all that you need..Has been using for a month now and it is working perfectly well. The connectivity is pretty impressive..The fit is perfect in ears and doesn't give pain after long hours.I was using MI Basic earphones for a year and switched into this and I think it was the best decision ever.Overall it is the perfect earpiece that u can have for enjoying uninterrupted songs and voice calls.
7656,4,Good choice,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ..."

7658,5,Fabulous!,"I just love this earphone. The sound quality is just awesome. The audio is pretty loud and decent, not harsh. The mic quality is also brilliant. It has Bluetooth 5.0. The connectivity is very easy. I can easily connect it with multiple devices. I like the music backup it almost lasts for 15 hr. Which is enough for my daily usage. I highly like this."
7659,5,Super!,"I recommended to all the buyer to go for this product only there are lots of brand in the market like noise, jbl, Realme boat and all but if your budget is 2000 then go for this item only you gona love it trust me. this is the long term review from my side and thanx me later."
7660,4,Value-for-money,"1. Call quality is Good. I have tested the call infront of high volume TV. The call was pretty good and didn't hear much noise if TV music. 4.5/52. Music is good. Bass is not as expected. But if you adjust the Equalizer, the Music is good. 4/5.3. Comfort is Pretty good. 5/5.4. Battery is also really good. 5/5."
7661,5,Highly recommended,"I've been using this product since last 6 months and i am excited to tell you that this product is worth the price. Its completely water resistant because once i was riding my bike through the city i had this headset worn my neck and it started raining and i was all set including the headset,i thought everything was over since water was everywhere and surpricingly everything works excellent when i connected again after reaching home. Working till now with no issues. Highly Recommended...."

7663,5,Super!,After use of 1 week i am writing this review and after searching for 6 months almost I bought this hands-free. My first priority was good battery backup which completely ful fill with this product. And also nice sound quality. Product delivered before time so thank for that.
7664,4,Good quality product,Some time audio can be disconnected...Change Audio tract is not working properly...I am so excited with battery life it's was really awesome...Audio and bass quality is not good but it ok...Worthy for this budget...If you need extra bass and extra audio don't choose it with my personal suggestion
7665,5,Excellent,What a product i ve ever used.i get it on very low price thank u flipkart for the wonderful offer.i have purchase 2 quantity one for my brother also.he is happy with this product.
7666,4,Very Good,Fast connecting user friendly good battery life studio quality surround quality stereo quality minute sound qualities always very good bass quality average bass uses I am not recommend.
7667,4,Good choice,"Rich clear sound , don't go for boat if you want a long term product , by spending 700 more get these , boat won't last long , if we tak about bass it's more and real in hd and 4k videos and normal in low quality video so bass depends on video quality ,saying by testing for 1hour straight from trailers to bass test to songs to movies... Just go it or if your budget is more just go for one plus earbuds for 3k but battery is still in testing mode charged full in 20-30min from 20%to 100 .."
7668,1,Unsatisfactory,Dont buy ...I recommend oppo enco m31 it has more useful features tban this stupid oneplus..my brother bought oppo enco m31.....and its way more useful and better than this...
7669,5,Wonderful,The quality of the headphone is awesome. Easy to connect to any mobile and PC. Sound quality and bass are satisfactory and worth every penny. Go for it!
7670,5,Super!,Simply outstandingReview after 5days of heavy usageFirst thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.
7671,5,Must buy!,Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.
7672,5,Worth every penny,I have used a lot of Bluetooth neckband earphones but after using OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition for a while now I can surely say that these are the best neckband earphones below 2000 rupees. Build quality is excellent. Material used is very premium. Sound quality is also top notch. Battery life is also very good. Very happy with this product.
7673,5,Worth every penny,One plus wirless blutooth hetset is very good I like the product I am waiting for 5month's the one plus blutooth hatset parchash so happy üòäü§≠‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for flipkart üéàüî•

7675,3,Just okay,"This is not a very good product as per brand value and its price bracket. People who have given very good rating perhaps not used any other earphone earlier. I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus. Investing almost 2k is not worth. It will better to go for boat.Guys one most important thing I wish to add here, please don't trust on YouTube vi..."

7677,5,Terrific,"I have been using it for over 3 months now. My priority is to take calls. Usage - 80% Official calls, 20% regular stuff. I am writing this review after using different brands TWS. I have segregated my points:1. I took it for my office calls as it gives flexibility to move around during lengthy calls. The sound quality is very good. Crisp and clear voice. The caller on the other side doesnt even come to know that we are using bluetooth device instead of wired headphones.2. Sound quality is v..."
7678,4,Good choice,"Should include switch button to switch between devices. The first time a used this, the sound quality was premium . earlier I was using boat rockerz 245. Yes there is bass to but for maximum effect you have to maximize the volume and you can't stay in this for long then . You Ave to adjust volume and equalisers. Magnetic on/off works very good ."
7679,5,Worth every penny,Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.
7680,4,Very Good,"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there. And comfortable too, itchiness or something like that doesn't happen after using for long hours. Microphone is good, no issues from the other side. And low latency mode best in this price range...even with a non-Oneplus device( I've a Samsung phone ). Overall valu..."
7681,4,Good quality product,Buy without any second thought just bought it and the sound quality is pretty darn good the bass is also good but not as punchy as realmebuds wireless but the bass is present and it's awesome the balanced sound quality is op
7682,4,Pretty good,No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.
7683,4,Good quality product,"This is my second OnePlus Bullets bass edition. Before I used normal edition. I am very much satisfied with this. Best battery backup I got ever, it give 5 to 7 days of backup. Thanks for Best Latency for playing Pubg and other games. I suggest everyone to just try this for once. Thanks OnePlus Never Settle."
7684,4,Value-for-money,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage. So if you get chance to try it before you can buy than that would I prefer and recommend. Else you won't be able to enjoy it to full.
7685,5,Must buy!,"Too good... At last 1+ improved in sound dept. You can feel each and every single note and the most good thing is you can hear tempo in one bud and others in the 2nd bud. I mean, the surround sound sistem is too good"

7691,3,Just okay,One thing I tell you that it has high bass. Bass lover will love it. But non bass Love it is headache. But sound quality and build quality is outstanding.
7692,3,Crackling noise on Mac; works fine on Windows & Android,Observed a crackling noise for high bass tracks on Mac. It goes away after factor reset but returns after a few tracks/on-off cycles. Works fine on Android & Windows. Mic quality is good and audio is well balanced overall.

7697,5,Worth every penny,OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition is the best bluetooth Neckband earphones I have used ever. They are of very high quality and sound output is also very very rich and clear. Its highly recommendable product. Got this in flipkart sale at very good pricing. However it is best wireless earphones priced under 2000. As always received super quick delivery by Ekart executive. Super satisfied with this purchase.

7701,3,Does the job,"Bass is not that smooth nor a destroyer to the ears. It is a blend of decent bass.I dont like the bass performance but the overall make, fit and finish is good. Built Quality is good. The higher variant of the Oneplus Wireless Bullets 2 are way too good than this product in terms of sound and quality.At this price point of Rs. 1799, this is not the best product. It sounds like a Rs. 1000 product which are also available on flipkart with different branding."

7707,5,Simply awesome,"ONEPLUS has done an excellent job.exceptional earphone with EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY, EXCELLENT BASS, EXCELLENT CALL QUALITY & EXCELLENT COMFORT...The final thing is battery... It's excellent in my words.I got more than 12 hours of battery backup throughout 3 days with more than 6 hours of calling. One more additional thing is that it can be charged within 50 minutes to 100% and 10 minutes of charging gives more than 60% of charge.FINAL VERDICT : GO FOR IT BLINDLY"
7708,3,Good,The build quality is GoodCharging time and battery backup is excellent.The sound quality is good but the sound clarity is not like a Rs2000 earphone
7709,3,Just okay,Product is good but as the name says baas edition it has not such a good bass but its decent sound quality is good but bass is not so satisfying
7710,5,Just wow!,Easy to carry. Best sound quality. Strong sensor. Water proofIn one word just wow
7711,3,Good,"Last version of one plus eaephones was more technologically advanced, this one has got all the good features except for the swap switch where just by pressing the button i could pair with different devices.Not so happy with it, also the battery back up is less compared to previous version of this.However its not that great nor is it too bad.Nothing so cool, its similar to realme or mi earphones."

But if u use boat and realme you never use this one.....but sound detail is very good.....you can listen evey minute instruments sounds.....And the very importet point of this headphone is. The best bluetooth neck band for pubg....no one can beat this one in case of pubg .....so if u are a pubg lover and no headphone jack dont worry ...
7714,5,Wonderful,"Actually this is the earphones that once I dreamt of. Now I got this and I am really really was excited about this.The sound quality is so far the best in the segment and the reengineered bass is so sick.The battery pack up has no issues cause it supports warp charging, so 10 minutes is crazy fast. And the built quality has been always better with one plus.So I am fully satisfied"
7715,5,Highly recommended,Product is great. Gets charge quickly and last for long. Sound and built quality is best within this price range. Not recommended for gamers though as letency is high. Great for watching movies or listening to music. Only problem is in calling. I have to keep left on ear and on right side hanging as it brings mic closer to mouth so that other end can hear the call clearly. If not than other end often complains about not hearing my voice clearly while using this earphone.
7716,4,Wonderful,Sound quality is really good and build is decent. The buttons are just not that great to be honest. Battery life is 12-14 hrs only. Don't expect more than thisBut the most important thing sound is excellent and bass is also well balanced. Price to performance is decent not that great.
7717,5,Highly recommended,"This is very good headphone AFAIK. It takes only 10mins to charge 80% (any charger which supports quick charge can be used, i used my poco 18W charger) which is sufficient for 10hrs usage. It takes 1hr to reach 100% charge.Battery life is fantastic i got around 15 to 16hrs. Volume is too high so can't go over 50%. Build quality looks nice, feels sturdy and the cable is braided. The fit is comfortable and Weightless. Sound quality is above average. Yeah bass is present. Call quality is excell..."
7718,5,Must buy!,The build quality of the earphone is very good sound is awsme bass is good enough it will not hurt your ear battery backup is awsme so overall product is very good
7719,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Sound quality is good, the bass thump is great! Instrument separation, sound clarity and soundstage is above average at this price point. The main highlight is the battery life. I have been using it for 2 weeks now, and it lasts around 15 hours on single full charge, and takes only 10 min to get charged to 70 80 % which indeed gives battery backup as claimed for 9 to 10 hrs. It also is somewhat on the comfortable side and very lightweight. Overall a great product considering the price point."
7720,5,Worth every penny,Awesome Quality Nice Sound & Bass I M Happy With This Product Thank You So Much One Plus & Flipkart
7721,3,Nice,"Good connectivity, battery backup and build quality. Sound quality is so average, definitely not as good as my boat rockers 255. Useful for office work, attending calls or listening to lectures. A big no for listening to music."
7722,5,Best in the market!,Battery backup is good. Charging speed also very fast. Not best but good sound quality. Worth for price. I am enjoying the product
7723,3,Decent product,Dont look only brand value. Good but not worthy for 1999. Go for any other like boat or something else.
7724,5,Awesome,Sound quality is decent bass is below average you don't expect bass like headphone. Best part about your earphone fast charging and battery backup just 15 minute charge and you're good to go for 10 to 12 hours
7725,5,Mind-blowing purchase,I liked everything about this bluetooth.call quality - Superb (everywhere)sound quality - very goodbattery backup - very good ( easily 2 days for normal users and for heavy users easily 1 day with 20% power left)Connectivity - Super fast (just seperate ear buds and done if ur blutooth is on and u connected it earlier)charging time - 10 min for 80% as far as i remember and its real3 ear tips provided and one type C charging cable with this.mterial quality used is very good and flexible...
7726,4,Pretty good,The collar and wire quality is good. Battery back up is bang on I mean I'm using it in my day to day calls and videos and it easily work for 8-10 hours on heavy usage. One thing that is missing is quick switch. I'm using the OP buds as well and quick switch on them works like magic to switch between devices.
7727,5,Simply awesome,I have purchased OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition Red recently and it is very useful. Red Color looks very premium. Quality of the product is also very good. I am very satisfied with the service. And as always thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery of the product. Flipkart as always is my favorite online store and provides with best service every time.

What I found was this bass edition is better than most other wireless earphones though some reviews said that build quality is not good.. what I feel is.. sound quality, bass ... Very good! Very happy about it.. Connectivity is top notch... Easy to wear... No any ear pain during long hours of usage.. But battery back up... Its been 5 days now.. I have charged it only 2 twice.. 10 mins full 100%... Wow! One..."
7731,4,Good quality product,Fantastic system it has but not have bass. Sound quality is average. I would like to inform you that do not waste your money by seeing ONEPLUS tag. You can buy better Wireless Earphone at very cheap price of Boat. Sound quality good but no to appreciate!
7732,4,Value-for-money,good product in bass edition but bass is not comparable with boat...... decent bass available. boat bass is good than one plus . battery life is best. 10 min. of charging gives 10 hrs of playtime
7733,5,Worth every penny,Best and most lovable one. The true one plus brand. Go for it without doubt. I assure this
7734,3,Fair,"hello, If you're 1+ Bullets wireless Z Bass user mean... You can hear opponents voice very well even if you ride bike. But Opponents didn't hear your voice when u ride bike and in travelling. Otherwise it's one of the best in this price.. Bass is powerful and Good."
7735,4,Pretty good,"I am writting this review after 3 weeks of usage.Sound-First thing first if you like to hear just bass and don't care about anything else then don't buy this one, go for Boat or Realme, but if you are like me who likes well balance sound with decent base then i think this is the best headset for this price, bass is not overpowering nether its dull its just comes alive when you need it.Battery-Most people will be impressed by its fast changing, i charge it for 10 minutes and it gives me..."
7736,4,Value-for-money,"Writing this review after 6 months(almost) of use.As price is concern the sound quality is quite good must say, no lag in connection if the versions are updated. It can catch a good distance and gives a good battery backup as well as good sound also.No issue so far, if someone wants a good deal under 1200 ,i must say go for it when sale is around."
7737,5,Just wow!,Best Quality üî•Osm productüíó and my favorite brand ‚ù£Ô∏èBest price range üî•Best wireless bluetooth headphone: oneplus ‚ù£Ô∏è these headphones light weight and camfortabule with a three Different sizes of silicone ear tips included so you can find the best fit for youüî•üî•üî•üî•Thanks üëçüòä
7738,4,Nice product,Its too much bass and somewhere it affects the quality of musicBut the battery is very good and im satisfied with batteryBut interms music quality i would prefer oppo enco m31
7739,5,Classy product,"I am very satisfied with this product, i got this one on 11 june morning, at that time 40 % charge used at today eve, at that time below 10 % so good battery back up, sound and bass vry good, i think this is the updated version,any way i am satisfied till now"
7740,5,Must buy!,"I am happy with the product I received. Packed tightly and got genuine product.This is after 10days review.I charged for 3time only- battery backup really niceNo irritation at all while placingThere is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving personSounds are really amazingI will re edit again after 20daysDesign, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.Nice one... Good ..."
7741,2,Expected a better product,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios.I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up.But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???"
7742,1,Hated it!,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience
7743,1,Terrible product,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me ü§¨
7744,1,Terrible product,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me, oppo, mivi, all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely"
7745,5,Excellent,NO WORDS..absolutely wonderful about the sound quality and vocal toning..bass is perfect all that you need..Has been using for a month now and it is working perfectly well. The connectivity is pretty impressive..The fit is perfect in ears and doesn't give pain after long hours.I was using MI Basic earphones for a year and switched into this and I think it was the best decision ever.Overall it is the perfect earpiece that u can have for enjoying uninterrupted songs and voice calls.
7746,4,Good choice,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ..."
7747,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Before purchasing I was so nervous about it. But now i bet no else wireless earphone can compete it....

7748,5,Fabulous!,"I just love this earphone. The sound quality is just awesome. The audio is pretty loud and decent, not harsh. The mic quality is also brilliant. It has Bluetooth 5.0. The connectivity is very easy. I can easily connect it with multiple devices. I like the music backup it almost lasts for 15 hr. Which is enough for my daily usage. I highly like this."
7749,5,Super!,"I recommended to all the buyer to go for this product only there are lots of brand in the market like noise, jbl, Realme boat and all but if your budget is 2000 then go for this item only you gona love it trust me. this is the long term review from my side and thanx me later."

7864,5,Excellent,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" üòÑüòÑüòâ"
7865,5,Super!,"Nice headphone, bass was very good and sound is clear. I am purchase for calling purpose and best choice even riding on bike wear in one ear and opposite end voice was clear and no complaint for calling.. Battery backup 1 full day"
7866,5,Super!,"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good."
7867,5,Terrific purchase,Sound quality super battery backup super quality super this price range super and this value for money
7868,4,Pretty good,Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.
7869,5,Terrific purchase,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet.."

7874,4,Good choice,Nice build quality.. bass is best it self.. vibrate at call is nice. .. nice support from flipkart and delivery partner
7875,1,Worthless,This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please
7876,3,Does the job,Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating)
7877,1,Terrible product,"After using for about 8 days, right side of the earphone is not working properly and the volume on right side is very low. I didn't expect this."

7879,1,Useless product,Mic is not proper recipient persons can't hear proper sound ( every time for call I heard from front I can't hear you so I have to again talk to through Mobile phone no Option useless of wirless meaning) and sound quality is so loud. Like local headphones. not comfortable to wear for more than1 hrs of uses.tere is no meanings to get replaced again you get same product therefore this is wast of money.

7893,5,Excellent,It's a Awesome purchase. Value for money. I can't expect that type of sound and connectivity will get in this price range. Last time I bought Boult ear buds and refunded due to charging issue and connectivity issue. That sound was not as powerful as this Boat headphone provides. Really happy to advise all of you if are searching for Bluetooth headphones please go for it. You will get everything you are searching for. Thanks Flipcart. And request all of you please go for only Indian Products.

7920,4,Pretty good,"To be frank it's not up to what i expected.... i have been using boat 900 for last couple of years... May be because it is wired one, the quality of audio is very good in 900.....

7933,5,Great product,Decent product and value for money. This is built with a very good design. The sound quality is medium and little low quality sound during calls and receiving calls. Not much of a bass sound quality effect. Overall a good product to go for in this price.

7945,3,Does the job,"Sound for listening music is sufficient and balanced sound for light user, bass is normal not a very high bass. Having distorted while making a call. But also a positive sign that is a battery backup, company provides 8hr battery backup and that's true, battery backup is very good at this price. Overall at this budget price range this boat 235v2 Bluetooth Headphone is good and value for money."

7949,4,Really Nice,Perfect sound for the perfect priceI have been using it from three months everything is working good and best compare to another boat earphone.I just don't know why the company not issued any warranty for it.THANQ

7953,4,Worth the money,"Awesome Product...It's a nice Bluetooth Headset, no doubt. It's sound is so sweet and design looks so good. It's battery backup is also very good. But using it for so long, it's bud make ears pain. So, for short time, it's very good product."

Sound is not crunchy, bass is good but treble is missing.3. Mic issue in each and every earphones sold ,I have tried in 3 different, opp person can't hear my voic..."
7958,5,Brilliant,"Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good."
7959,5,Terrific purchase,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet.."
7960,5,Simply awesome,It's a very good product ... I'm so happy with this BCz its bass quality & sounds is too good & batry back up Also super
7961,4,Delightful,First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good. I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.
7962,5,Simply awesome,Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great üëå and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great
7963,5,Wonderful,"Wowwww it's amezing bluetooth nice look, nice price, nice battery back up, I love always flipkart product's and Flipkart replacement and refund policy, you can return or refund after received a demegzed product"
7964,4,Good choice,Nice build quality.. bass is best it self.. vibrate at call is nice. .. nice support from flipkart and delivery partner
7965,1,Worthless,This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please
7966,3,Does the job,Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating)
7967,1,Terrible product,"After using for about 8 days, right side of the earphone is not working properly and the volume on right side is very low. I didn't expect this."
7968,4,Good quality product,It's a very good product... I'm so happy with this Bcz it's bass quality & sounds is too good & battery backup also superb
7969,5,Brilliant,It is very good product in the price range. And it looks like apple Air pods. Very cool design and awesome product. The sound is good and build is strong. I say go for it better than any other.
7970,5,Must buy!,I really like the quality of case. Its compact and easy to carry. The sound is very deep and clear. Amazing audio qualitya and deep bass. C type slot and cable with fast charging. A complete full package with minimum cost. Worth buying this.
7971,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."
7972,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
7973,5,Best in the market!,"Finally every feature that i want merged to one single brand. Happy with bass, treble, crystal clear sound, perfect for calling, very comfortable to ears, decent look, best battery backup, build quality excellent. Everything is perfect."

8004,1,Absolute rubbish!,"Touch controls is not working,Wrost product"
8005,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"

8017,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It is the best tws in this price range. Ergonomic design is absolutely perfect, it doesn't fall even while riding a bike. Touch controls are also smooth. On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

8069,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."

8092,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes . Boat should have provided more ear hooks of different sizes so it could be comfortable for everyone if you have normal or big sized ears , this product will be perfect for you the sound quality is very good, built quality is very good wire length is perfect . This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for meThankyou"

8100,3,Just okay,Sound quality is good but ear hurts after long usage. It firmly holds its position in ear which quite good for some users but ok for short period of time. Over all sound is good bass is better and wire design is strong.
8101,5,Brilliant,a really nice earphone for music....and superb for mobile gamingit supports surround sound..bass is little less compared to the bassheads 225 but is not like it has no bass......its bass is balanced i would say as more bass than this causes problem in gaming and after playing shooting games ur head will become vibrator.....overall they are good ear phones
8102,5,Mind-blowing purchase,What a sound quality totaly worth the money. i loved this one but boAt bassheads 225 has more booming bass then this one. I am not saying it doesn't have deep bass it has but not that deep which a bass lover likes but it has crystal clear sound quality which let's you experience clear sound with deep bass overall i am in love with these earphones.

8114,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."

The performance is great worth money but one thing lacks is the build of 2 rubber like support near the earphones it got loosed and streched within a week too poor quality rubber user whereas the wire are little thick and good that's comfortable.

8136,3,Decent product,"Good design and sound quality (although I am not a fan of bass headphones). I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great. Lots of issues like sound loop, echoes, other person unable to hear loud and clear if the wires are hanging (like in normal cases). If you bring the mic close to the mouth, only then you are properly audible + echoes are there no matter what. So, all in all it is good for those who likes bass headphones, but don't r..."
8137,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."

8141,5,Worth every penny,Awesome and good product nice bass and sound quality awesome for this price
8142,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
8143,4,Worth the money,It was very smooth and clear bass and it is very stylish look.I like it .superr
8144,5,Highly recommended,It is a nice product but comparing this with basshead 100. In my opinion basshead 100 is better than fitting in ear easily. Not ideal product for using it normally to watch movies. For sports activity it is great

8147,4,Good quality product,"Sound quality is good for the price. I'm a music producer so I know a little bit about sound. Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass.

Build quality considering price point is good.Cons:The ear hook provided was uncomfortable for me so has to remove the ear ...
8170,5,Best in the market!,"The sound quality of the neckband is just awesome. The sound is totally clear and bass is really high. It gave me a total 3D effect while gaming. Latency is negligible and the microphone is also fine. The control buttons come handy for various controls. The best thing is, it only takes an hour for charging but lasts for more than 20 hours. The fit of the neckband is just perfect. Also they provided extra ear pieces. Overall a great purchase in such a good price range."

However, overall it's an awesome neckband, you can buy it without any hesitation."
8173,5,Fabulous!,Bettry backup is just awesome . To just check I play it on full volume overnight and when I wake up it's still at 60 percent of bettary so it will provide u continuous power for more than 20 hours in single charge at full volume.

8179,3,Fair,I bought this product mainly due to its 24 battery backup but it disappointed me the says it lasts for 24hrs but it lasts for 10-12 hrs everything else is good in this price range. Eartips are good fit and sound is clear but battery is not as promised by the company

8205,5,Highly recommended,Just loved it ‚ù§
8206,1,Horrible,Boult Audio - Just like many other a brand name given to low quality made in China products.My experience while using with Laptop ( MS Teams) & Phone for calls-* Fast Draining Battery.* Pathetic Mic. Other Party can't hear me at all.. It sounds to them like I'm speaking from 6 Feet away from mic.* Software is buggy. It hungs in between with loud beep noise.. Have to restart the earphone to be able to use again.* Build Quality is average. Not upto the price paid.
8207,1,Waste of money!,Mic doesn't work properly and also battery backup is not 24 h.waste of money

8256,5,Classy product,Very Comfortable In Ear good sound quality
8257,3,Good,Built quality is good. For all other aspects like battery backup etc have to wait for some daysAfter use of 10 days. You will not get clear voice while riding and it absorbs more distrubance surrounding you.
8258,1,Horrible,Third class
8259,4,Delightful,"You can feel 3d sound effect in normal songs...Sound quality is goodfinishing in neckband is not good...Lack of premium look...Battery backup is not tested yet...Overall as per price of 999 rs, you can go for it..."
8260,2,Not good,Bass is very very bad.Instead you can buy Flipkart smartbuy earphones it will give more bass n clear sound.Try other brands in same price range. Not good
8261,3,Fair,Product is not listed on Boult's website.Ear buds are magnetic but it does not gets off by attaching the buds.You have to manually switch on it everytime.Headphone have auto shutdown feature but after shutdown you have to power it on manually.Headphone disconnects randomly.Audio quality is average typeOneplus headphone is much better than this.

8280,5,Must buy!,I really like the quality of case. Its compact and easy to carry. The sound is very deep and clear. Amazing audio qualitya and deep bass. C type slot and cable with fast charging. A complete full package with minimum cost. Worth buying this.
8281,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."
8282,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...

8314,1,Absolute rubbish!,"Touch controls is not working,Wrost product"
8315,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"

8327,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It is the best tws in this price range. Ergonomic design is absolutely perfect, it doesn't fall even while riding a bike. Touch controls are also smooth. On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

8395,5,Super!,"Nice headphone, bass was very good and sound is clear. I am purchase for calling purpose and best choice even riding on bike wear in one ear and opposite end voice was clear and no complaint for calling.. Battery backup 1 full day"
8396,5,Super!,"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good."
8397,5,Terrific purchase,Sound quality super battery backup super quality super this price range super and this value for money
8398,4,Pretty good,Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.
8399,5,Terrific purchase,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet.."
8400,5,Simply awesome,It's a very good product ... I'm so happy with this BCz its bass quality & sounds is too good & batry back up Also super
8401,4,Delightful,First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good. I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.
8402,5,Simply awesome,Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great üëå and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great
8403,5,Wonderful,"Wowwww it's amezing bluetooth nice look, nice price, nice battery back up, I love always flipkart product's and Flipkart replacement and refund policy, you can return or refund after received a demegzed product"
8404,4,Good choice,Nice build quality.. bass is best it self.. vibrate at call is nice. .. nice support from flipkart and delivery partner
8405,1,Worthless,This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please
8406,3,Does the job,Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating)
8407,1,Terrible product,"After using for about 8 days, right side of the earphone is not working properly and the volume on right side is very low. I didn't expect this."
8408,4,Good quality product,It's a very good product... I'm so happy with this Bcz it's bass quality & sounds is too good & battery backup also superb
8409,5,Fabulous!,Great product..I loved it.. As I was using level U..This product is much more better than that..Though battery life is just like 8hrs and bass like goosebumps... But when increased bass earplugs starts raddling.. Vibrate feature is awesome..
8410,3,Just okay,"I got this earphone right now everything was ok but when i plugged in charging led light was not working it was really low when i saw it properly , I don't know if this is with my piece only or led is low ."
8411,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Boat headset is very clear voice and bass is v good and plus point is fast charging 20 mint to 4 hrs batery backup... One of the best bluetooth headset....osmmm products
8412,4,Nice product,"Awesome product happy to have one.Good sound quality in medium volume, with equalizer app could complete the high bass sound.Battery last long 20 min of charge to enjoy whole day.Very light weight, Easy to carry,"
8413,5,Excellent,It's a Awesome purchase. Value for money. I can't expect that type of sound and connectivity will get in this price range. Last time I bought Boult ear buds and refunded due to charging issue and connectivity issue. That sound was not as powerful as this Boat headphone provides. Really happy to advise all of you if are searching for Bluetooth headphones please go for it. You will get everything you are searching for. Thanks Flipcart. And request all of you please go for only Indian Products.

8440,4,Pretty good,"To be frank it's not up to what i expected.... i have been using boat 900 for last couple of years... May be because it is wired one, the quality of audio is very good in 900.....

8451,4,Wonderful,Im a jbl user ..boat 235v2 battery is too good to stay 2 days..fast charging..bass is 5 of 5 but sound of vocal is 4 of 5.. mic is good ..although i bought this in 1299 ..in this range its good

8465,3,Does the job,"Sound for listening music is sufficient and balanced sound for light user, bass is normal not a very high bass. Having distorted while making a call. But also a positive sign that is a battery backup, company provides 8hr battery backup and that's true, battery backup is very good at this price. Overall at this budget price range this boat 235v2 Bluetooth Headphone is good and value for money."

8478,5,Brilliant,"Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good."
8479,5,Terrific purchase,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat.

8502,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I'm rating this 5.0. Everything is on top as per the price range. The only problem I'm having with it is. No soft ear-cups. When you are listening music, after 1 hours it starts paining and you can't wear it for that entire day. It is totally understandable in this price range premium things shouldn't be expected but it could have been improved. Anyways, I'm #boAthered."
8503,4,Good quality product,Product worth the price. Good quality sound and bass. But build quality is not as good as I expect
8504,1,Worst experience ever!,It's too good and the sound quality is good but when in online classes when we should on Mike then it is not working but super
8505,5,Mind-blowing purchase,I'm in love with this product. Very good sound quality and even the headphones are compact and comfortable to wear and the main thing that's attracts u is the bassü•∞üòçüòç
8506,3,Good,"Little issue with clarity and the sound cuts, sometimes while using it the device itself cuts one side. Sometimes left side of the headset didn't work for 5 seconds, sometimes right side doesn't works"
8507,5,Super!,"This product is awesome having great sound, bass, echo... If anybody wants to buy it... then please don't hesitate and go for it........ quality worth every penny of your money.."
8508,5,Worth every penny,"I bought this for my WFH scene. FYI, when wired the mic doesn't work but, in the bluetooth mode the headset does a marvelous job. Fortunately my system happens to have a bluetooth connect mode and so, it is serving my purpose. Good & comfy. Worth the money i spent."
8509,5,Must buy!,Nice product ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÇüôÇ I Love it..... Thanks boAt and thank flipkart...... For safe and fast delivery
8510,5,Brilliant,The sound of the üéß is super duper and so as the design and feature. I love it! It is worth buying.
8511,4,Worth the money,Great buy !The headphones are nice and comfortable on the ears. The sound quality is good with high bass and the sound clarity is pretty good. It lasts fairly well after 1 charge. Connects hassle-free with both mobiles and laptops.Bought for a friend and she liked it.
8512,4,Very Good,Fine product but I figured that left one is more clear than the right one and the size is not suitable for people with larger head
8513,4,Pretty good,"Too good product. I have used many head phones before,but this is is just awesome. Sound quality and and the bass it just nailed other famous brand like JBL. Don't think about much,just go for it guys, you will feel like heaven and the battery back up is more than 8-9 hours for daily use which is too good. No connection dropped during playing the video or audio. Build quality is very nice and also very light weight for ears."
8514,4,Really Nice,It's a nice product with a medium bass. The sound clarity is awesome. I bought it for client's meeting and all. So mike clarity and sound clarity are compulsory. If it has more bass then vocals may not clear. I recommend for business and office use
8515,2,Not good,This can be used only for listening songs but can not use for office calls as the Mike doesn't work with both Bluetooth as well as with cable. So not useful for calling..
8516,5,Awesome,Best battery but if you use it in full volume than it s volume disturbes you but the bass is very good as i wanted i prefer all to purchase it because it is value for money
8517,5,Must buy!,Super good and classy happy to have this.
8518,5,Classy product,Amazing product am shocked... because.. my.. past i never use.. this type of product its very amazing and also.. good... and last... the packing is awesome... very carefully they are taken.. thank you so much.. filpkart.. and @ekart
8519,5,Highly recommended,"Delivery was fastest on COD mode payment. On 2nd day recieved the product in good condition. Look is good, sound and base quality is good in both wired and wireless mode, battery backup is also good as expected. It is fully comfortable for use as the earbuds are of proper leather and of good quality and not like JBL earbuds of plastic material which gets off after rough usage.

8793,5,Terrific purchase,Such a good product it was in this price range...I was using Epson products from last 7 years...
8794,3,Just okay,Product is good. Ink lasts long but don't keep printer idle for more than a week else head cleaning would be required.Driver installation is a tough task in itself. Scanner is not functional in my printer yet.

8798,4,Delightful,Epson L3151 is good printing. I've been using it for one month. The printing quality is excellent. It took 10-15 sec for a b&w page and about 30sec for colour page. But build quality of this printer could be better.The seller sent it very unsafely. Packaging is too cheap.

8808,2,Moderate,Delivery is on time. No problem with the dispatch.But the product is faulty. But technician told it will be replaced with new product.Anyways first impression is best impression. Thats why the rating is kept poor.Request flipkart to ensure the F-Assured items are working and seller needs to ensure the working condition before dispatch.Thanks to Epson service team for replacement with new one in 4 days.
8809,5,Best in the market!,It is nice and light weight printer with easy installation. It has multiple modes to print photos like standard and high quality. Refilling of printer is also quite simple and doesn't require expertise. Epson customer care is also very supportive in installation and demo. I got same day delivery and installation. Overall I have taken good decision to buy this. For others just go for it ....

8869,4,Delightful,"Canon G3012 is the same as G3010 but with two extra black bottles of ink. So, this review is applicable for both the models. The flipkart delivery was on time and packing was satisfactory. Coming to the Printer.... The setup of easy. I was waiting for the Canon guy to come and install but then I decided to install it myself. Took me 15 mins to install. The print quality is satisfactory. Wireless printing setup was a bit typical but is a one time hassle. I took out some b/w and colour prints ..."
8870,5,Simply awesome,Very Nice ProductPrinter is fast and smooth colours are good in compare to other printers in the marketThe big plus point of buying Canon printers that they have seprate individual cartage for black and colour ink so it saves money while servicing of the product and Extra black ink bottels are also a big advantage.
8871,5,Great product,"Superb printer. Easy to install. During this Covid 19 scenario, we were reluctant to do the installation by someone else. I was wondering whether I could do it by myself. But I did it at ease. Almost a plug and play time. Only cartridge to be inserted and inks to be filled, the rest is well taken care of by the printer itself. I tried photo printing, colour printing and b/w printing. I am really impressed. Photo printing I need to purchase glossy paper I think for better effect. The price is ..."

8873,4,Really Nice,"I have been using Epson's L555 for close to 5 years and bought this as a backup. On the plus side I would say that the colour and scan speed is slightly better in comparison to the Epson. The sturdiness, fit and finish, print speed and noise levels could do with some improvement. In all I would rate this as a good product and am happy with it."
8874,5,Perfect product!,Satisfied with the printer.Color page cost I am not sure as Canon claims but I have yet to check it.Black ink for sure works quite well. Have taken around 50 pages and still the level of ink hasn't deteriorated.Sending it after using it for almost 4 months. The printer is really worth.Color print quality is good though the color seems to fade away in few months (can be because i kept the photos in open stick to my refrigerator or the paper quality might not be really good.)
8875,4,Good choice,"Have been using this printer for last 2 weeks and it's good so far. The setup was ok, had some hiccups in configuring Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz (no 5 GHz), but could able to manage it with the USB connection, Support for Windows & Android is good, but doesn't support Airprint.

8885,4,Worth the money,After a week usageThe printer is perfect for home and small office usage. The print quality was good as expected. But sometimes when we print whole black pages it sometimes spread maybe it is due to the season or what. Overall it is the best Inktank printer in market.

8887,5,Classy product,Meets expectations. Installation process took half an hour in total. Simple steps are given for installation and no problem occurred while following them. I tried printing photos on glossy paper and it works perfectly well. Wireless printing working fine from laptop as well as mobile.
8888,5,Best in the market!,Awesome printer with great detailing in photo printing. Way better than epson and hp. Setting up wireless printing thorough mobile is easy but tricky while doing with laptop. Canon guy will help you to install it completely. Go blindly for this.
8889,2,Expected a better product,"First of all not supported with Mac OS,Printing speed is very slow,No support from Flipkart side once product is delivered,Price is high as compared to other brands with same or more features with all OS supported.Mobile app is also poor,cost of management like cartridge and ink is high from whatever mentioned on the website."

If you really searching for a color printer within Good Budget and Quality always Go for this model. Thank You CANON, Thank You Flipkartüëç"
8977,5,Classy product,Meets expectations. Installation process took half an hour in total. Simple steps are given for installation and no problem occurred while following them. I tried printing photos on glossy paper and it works perfectly well. Wireless printing working fine from laptop as well as mobile.
8978,5,Best in the market!,Awesome printer with great detailing in photo printing. Way better than epson and hp. Setting up wireless printing thorough mobile is easy but tricky while doing with laptop. Canon guy will help you to install it completely. Go blindly for this.

Although installation is easy.After connecting to my pc with USB and wifi it prints slowly: but after installation of brother drivers it works very fast(but not as fast as cartridge inkjet printers). One more thing I notice is that color print is much faster than monochrome print. Photo prints are very nice.Problem. I have face is black is not bla...
8981,5,Super!,"Amazing printer for the price offered. Love the print quality, it can print in eco mode, normal and even fine photo quality print. It has the all in one functionality of scan, copy and print. These ink tank printers are very economical for home and office use. Also since Brother printers are designed in Japan, you can definitely trust them."

It cost 150 rupees per bottle of ink and has 100 ml. Cartridge can be refilled upto 20-25 times from ink bottle. After refilling the printing cost of color mode comes down to 0.99 to 1.20 rupees and black 0.30 rupees estimated by me.2. No problem with software.3. If refilling cartridge then you require some technical guidelines and can search on...
9209,5,Wonderful,"The printer is easy to install, demo is available in the HP website asvwell as in youtube. Can print from mobile phone as well, this feature is very useful for taking print out of study material for kids. The quality of print is good, most useful feature is duplex printing without manual intervention. This certainly helps to reduce paper consumption. Color printing quality is not impressive.Strongly recommend it for personal use"
9210,4,Nice product,"Owsom printer in this range I am very happy with this printer , one nice thing of this printer is wireless connection between printer or mobile which is enable for scan or printing but through rougher. if you haven't any router then don't worry. you can use other mobile hotspot and connect printer or a mobile in other mobile hotspot , after that set your password and ready for use."

9213,5,Good Product from Canon,This is one of the best printer for home use. I could setup the printer connect with my netgear wifi router with WPA2 encription & with MAC Id filter without any trouble. Print quality is good and economical too.

9214,3,WiFi Setting is not Easy,"For all those complaining about WiFi problems, just register a complaint with Canon customer support. I am an expert WiFi user and I could not make the printer work on WiFi, which ever way I tried. WPS did not work. Tried three different WiFi routers no use.

9216,4,Overall great printer for this price range,"In the Box:Printer came with 2 black cartridges and 1 color cartridge. The 1 extra black cartridge was because of some offer by the OEM itself, which wasn't mentioned at the time of purchase, but nevertheless was appreciated since it was included within the box.Setting Up:Was easy to set up and get started printing, though I feel Canon's software is too bloated (almost 2 GB).

9217,5,Good One,"I bought this about 6 months and using it for home usage. It is pretty nice product which solves the domestic needs like school projects, photo copy, ticket print outs and other medium requirements. Worth buy it. Wi-Fi printing is pretty tricky. Your Wi-Fi router should have a WPS button to syncup with the printer. Airtel supplied modems won't work."

9219,2,"waste a lot of papers, per paper cost is high","Printer is not good for daily uses.1. Most of time doesn't take paper automatically from tray. You have to pick a paper and push adjust it so that printer can take it for print.2. Paper jam is very common. You'll waste at least 2-3 papers per day.3. Consume a lot of ink, specially colour.4. Both black and colour cartridges are expensive. 1 Black cart. prints approx 300 pages (more than ‚Çπ1.5 per paper) . I didn't count for colour cart. but it's not much.It's definitely not for daily use..."
9220,4,Worth the money,Printer üñ®Ô∏è is good
9221,3,Just okay,good for home ND small office work. Wi-Fi not connecting with mobile
9222,5,Highly recommended,Best affordable Printer in This cost Ink One cartrage Printed Almost 350 pages in Greyscale Ink ie black ink only and still ink is 15 percent remaining Colour ink i hvnt used but yes If u have Official regular use go for it
9223,3,Nice,The colour cartridge I received is off only 40% filled. After taking 5 colour printout the colour bottom is glowing with an indication that the colour cartridge is low . Connecting with the wifi is too horrible. Rest of the things is okay with that price range . If your planning to take more colour printouts then really don't go with this product. Taking Black and white colour printout is cost effective.
9224,3,Good,"It's a perfect one for the small business use!!!Professional!!! Compact!!!You may ask,then why you rated 3star..It's because of the delivery issue!I got the delivery without any connection cable's and ink cartridges!But then, they changed it immediately and responded back with the new one on Air freight wihin a week of time!"

The new product also didn't work but after a lot of experiments the guys made it work.

9244,5,Classy product,Descent
9245,5,Worth every penny,"Printer working just fine,but 0 out of 5 for the worst ever packing i have ever seen for such a big fragile electronic goods from flipkart. Only brand carton box that was so badly torn with big hole near carton holder literally i could just pull out the printer from carton. Was so afraid to even get it from the delivery person, but thankfully the printer inside was intact with no immediately visible damage. Otherwise the product is working well till now."
9246,4,Really Nice,The duplex print feature at this price point along with wi-fi is simple great.The draft mode print quality in b&w for plain text is also very good.Over all satisfied with the purchase.

9252,1,Unsatisfactory,"Never go for this product, Its not able to connect using WiFi and after multiple request for Technician visit. No one bothered to visit. Never ever buy from this seller. ITHUBBLR - Worst seller on Flipkart. I have paid 500/ more for this product compared to other sellers by seeing his previous reviews. Looks like the seller's stomach is full now."

9255,2,Very costly Print,This printer is a high cost by printing up to 230 pages of A4 documents with the PG-89 ink cartridge and up to 60 pages with the CL-99 ink cartridge.But this print Quality is very good.Canon E560 printer speed 1min/10pages.My expreancy is perfect Print quality And speedBut Print Very costly
9256,1,Useless product,one single sided print will take more than a minute..i have taken 5 color photos n it says no ink
9257,4,Good product,"The printer is perfect and very easy to operate. It serves all the described purposes of scanning, printing and copying. It is easy to assemble and understand, however pain to set up Wi-Fi and the cannon technicians are not helpful either. The printer vibrates a lot while printing. Serves the purpose."

9673,4,A steal for office works.,this laser printer is a steal for office work as it is 1. laser printer 2. extremely offordable 5600/-. 3. auto duplex printer 4. high paper yield of 2000 pages 5. compact with inbuilt paper tray Cons: as it is laser printer it's power hungry so difficult to run on inverter battery in case of power outage.

9930,1,Did not meet expectations,Very bad printer ...Even not scan full document ....Image quality on 180gsm not good as expected colour not dry after a long time on paper....My suggestion don't buy that printer
9931,1,Worthless,"This is heights of stupidity... option is there but No both side printing, Unable to download any software from HP site, redirecting to Microsoft store, which is of no use. Just too 7 color pages and color cartridge gone... This printer Sucks... Total waste of money, returning it now"

9944,2,Could be way better,Not worked
9945,4,Good quality product,Very good
9946,4,Nice product,Good product for home use. Prints are good. There is some driver installation problem from Hp smart if you have office laptop and Microsoft Store is blocked from access. In that case you have to download drivers and software from options which is just below the main software update. There are 3 to 4 downloads and after that your printer is installed with the system.
9947,5,Great product,Best printer in 4999 price rangePrinting speed is very fast

9995,4,Very Good,"Nice product quality is good printing was little bit slow but the performance was soo good and copy ,scan was too good and it was fast"
9996,5,Super!,"Good model. Does its job well and the ink lasts long. Print quality as per industry standards, color reproduction is ok. This printer is not for photo prints so cannot expect a great performance in that section. For documents it's perfect. The auto doc. feeder is a addition but I feel they could have kept it as an optional attachment, as for those who do not need it, for them it just makes the printer bulkier!"
9997,1,Useless product,Print quality is very poor and the ink exhausted very fast. Though there is return policy but not able to return because the given problem is not accepted by flipkart.
9998,5,Wonderful,Photoquility is best
9999,2,Expected a better product,Connectivity issue. Not a seamless connection or printing wirelessly. Printing is slow even in black and white. Expected a better product from HP. One will get irritated while printing via wifi. Mobile printing sucks. The app is very confusing and irritating. Ink finishes like anything even the black ink. Auto document feeder does not work properly and copies blank pages. Paper tray problem happens most of the times. Don't buy it. Please.

10141,3,Good but read this before you buy,A very good printer for moderate business or personal use. Even it is the cheapest & very nice printer if you are looking for a Printer+Copier+Scanner+Laser technology+HP.But the finishing of the product is terrible. The front & top faces are fine but the back & inner portions are terribly casted. Also the scanner tray is not so rigid.So I would suggest to spend few more bucks & go for HP M1005.Toners used:HP M 1136-88A.HP M 1005-12A.The printing capacity of 1005 is around 25% more th...
10142,5,Extremely good printer,"Easy to install, quick print, nice scanner. Good for small business and offices. Requires less space. xerox kind function is also good. Must buy if you are looking for low budget high performing printer.Only drawback is it can't print both side automatically, but at such good price it can be ignored."
10143,5,All in one and value for money,"I bought this printer after a lot of research, one thing was pretty sure that i wanted a laserjet and not an inkjet and also that i wanted an all function printer, not only a printer.I had a choice between the samsung and this hp M1136. Both were in my budget but bought hp cause of the more positive reviews on flipkart by the other buyers who have used either one.Coming to the printer, its heavy, sturdy and the black colour looks classy. The design is superb, the make quality is excellent..."
10144,4,simple affordable and fast,This is a very good MFP by hp as I have used other brands like canon and samsung but this is the best printer in its category so go for it. And great job by flipkart to deliver in just 20 hours of placing order.
10145,5,Simply awesome,Really excellent Purchaseworking very good and delivery was fastFully satisfied with HP Printer and Flipkart.
10146,5,Nice printer,"Pros: Nice printer, does its job as advertised. Easy to handle, set up is also easy and hassle free. I was looking for a home printer and dwelling over an ink jet and laser jet. I found this one perfect for me as I don‚Äôt need to print many color pages. HP print software is always nice. The scanner is good and the copier function is very useful, as you don‚Äôt need to hook up your laptop or PC every time to make a copy.Cons: The paper input tray always project out and is not foldable or retract..."
10147,5,Great Multifunction Printer !,"This printer is extremely good ! Gives nice crisp Professional Prints , Scanner is Fast Enough , and its a pretty good printer ! the downside is the software bundled with it ! Has not many features . So download from the HP original website . Overall very good Product ! Totally worth the money . Flipkart delivered one day late as promised, But thats okay cause i was not in a hurry to get it !!!"
10148,4,Value-for-money,"Great deal in big billion sale. Easy to assemble, good performance, took a little bit more time to deliver but that was expected bcoz of the ongoing ""Big Billion Sale"""
10149,5,Good as a Printer. Too Bad as a Scanner,"Everything worked well with this printer until I scanned my first document on it.Very Poor Software offered by HP. Every document scans Twice for the reason unknown to me. Canon E500 that I used earlier had a lot better scanner than this one.As far as the Printer is concerned, hats off. It works great! Speed is awesome. Copying speed is great.Sans the scanner, everything is perfect."
10150,4,A good and affordable printer,"A good all-in-one printer at an affordable price.However, a drawback is that it doesn't have an Ethernet port if one might want to make it networked, though there's the symbol of network connectivity engraved on its back.And, Kudos to Flipkart for a speedy and safe delivery!"
10151,5,"very nice, multifunction laser printer","worth considering for home use..though somewhat bulky, but works fine... have been using for last two weeks, nice output, crisp printing, only A4 photo copier but quite satisfied with the product due to refillable cartridge."
10152,4,Nice product,"Writing this review after a month's usage.It's nice, the best thing about this is that you can easily make a xerox copy without the intervention of a PC.Very fast in printing.But The HP UI is not user friendly.Canon gives mp navigator which helps us to do alot of things easily but here even though the scanner n printer are better but the UI lacks proper design.Many third party drivers are available to overcome this problem but are paid version.A normal user cannot use this printer at it..."
10153,5,Awesome Printer by HP,I bought this printer 6 months ago and I will be honest that this is the one of the best printer so far I have seen.Pros:1. Best Laser Printer and gives very good print out.2. Gives good number of print out.3. Scanner is awsome and can be configured to get good pixel density scan.Cons:1. Black and White Printer.2. No Wifi support.I will not count this as Cons as it was mentioned in the specification but its pros are that good that you can ignore its cons.Shushank Shukla
10154,4,Decent Product,"1. Scanner is of good quality, though the software provided is a very basic one. It does not support fast scanning and needs manual intervention every time.2. Printer quality is good.3. Photo copy is also good."
10155,5,Terrific,"For home user this is a laser printer,affordable and hp has a good service. Installation is very easy,it comes with the cd . Printing qlty is good, scanning takes times ,but is of good qlty for home users. it comes with hp starter cartilage which gives aprox 700 prints on economy mode.overall its a good product,better then ink jet as no issue of ink drying, flipkart delivered before time and in a good packing."
10156,5,Awesome Printing Experience on both windows and Linux OS,"I brought this from a normal offer on Flipkart and It works fine.The basic test cartridge shipped along with the product had printed many pages than expected.The printing quality is fine and when I struck with some issues with printer ,I got a excellent customer care experience with HP Care support.Printing:5 StarScanning: 5 StarPhotoCopy: 5 Star.Working fine with windows(When I connected for first time,the printer got recognized automatically-Thanks to autoSetup by HP).In linux follow ..."
10157,4,Great printer within the price bracket.,The print seems incredible within the price bracket. Scanning is pretty good. however the copy feature seems ok a the copy comes with very dark ink and there does not seem to be a method to lighten so that the print comes a bit light in case of copy.In all a pretty good printer will adequate feature unless you really avoid refilling powdered toner..!! :P as during refilling it spills all over and while refilling you have to wear masks and proper gloves in order to protect yourself from tone...

10173,5,Simple Awesome,Perfect printerEasy installationDoes all the work like a charm.Awesome scan quality.Printing is awesome with crisp and perfect edges of text and good contrast in image printing too.Photocopy feature is good enough.Highly Recommendable :)
10174,4,Great for home/office,"Its great for home as well as for office, there is a slight problem of user interface for MAC users, you need to download an older version of HP Driver probably for 10.7 for newer versions print may work fine but issues with scanning as a full featured driver for 10.8 and later versions is still not out. Besides this sharing this printer on network through a MAC is another pain. For single users this is a product that brings wonders."
10175,5,Great Value For Money,This is a pretty fast mono laser printer(+scanner+copy) machine. Very very easy to setup. I am really happy with the product. If u wanna grab one just for ur home office do not hesitate to go with this product.
10176,5,Great Printer,"I bought it for my office use. The reason for buying was the swift printing a laser printer delivers.It has been upto my expectations in printing speed. It has by far exceeded the expectations on cartridge life. Printed a good 600 pages till now and now it is getting hungry for ink but promised 50 prints more.Does Scanning and Xerox as well, hence a total office solution."

10186,4,HP Laserjet Pro M1136,Its a very good multi purpose machine and very helpful in scanning/copying.. I am happy with its performance and also its delivery it truly unbelievable. its a very great experience.
10187,5,HP LaserJet Pro - M1136 Multifunction Laser Printer,This is a simple and good to use printer. Easy to install and start using it right away. Still have to check on the toner performance in the coming few weeks. Overall a good product.
10188,5,Machine full of utility,"Very good machine for people who are trying to avoid frequent drying cartridges of inkjet printers, this is a very good option as it includes additional features of scan and copy. Multiple functionality for copying like zooming, multiple copy, and brightness control are also there.Scan speed and quality are also good.Worth Purchasing."

10190,5,nice one,Nice Printer fast and really good with nice printing quality so if u want a nice laser printer go fir it...............
10191,4,nice,excellent phone with nice colors. One of the affordable mobile for all. But The offer am looking for is not here as expected by me. I got a good offers from the Panasonic.
10192,5,awesome is the word,"overall quality is just awesome. solid build, this printer is perfect for photo-copy with many functions like enlarge, dark/light, etc. although the software provided for scanning is not that user friendly but no issue with scanning... its crystal clearand the crucial part, printing is just flawless...its a laser printer which can only print black and white, anyway you wont get a colour laser printer at this price range. refilling can be done (u will have to compromise on quality) but its b..."
10193,5,,official website and even flipkart says that this printer doesn't support legal sized paper.but it works fine .. i was scared .. but now i am happy..the scanning quality of the printer is just amazing .... AMAZING
10194,5,HP LaserJet Printer,This is a very good MFP by hp as I have used other brands like canon and samsung but this is the best printer in its category so go for it. And great job by flipkart to deliver in just 20 hours of placing order.
10195,5,is it support with inverter,i m searching a MFP laser printer which is support inverter power.it is a nice printer bt any one can tell that can we use it in INVERTER n is it support in INVERTER becuse mostly HP printer not support INVERTER due to high voltage like hp 1005 if it support it will best for me n i also buy a colour printer in low bugget
10196,5,Awesome Product and Awesome Flipkart's Service,This product from HP is just great and the quality is also phenomenal that too under a decent price tag.. I highly recommend this product...And I have to say flipkart service is the best... the product came at it's scheduled date even though the product got approved after 1 day delay... Hats off to Flipkart!
10197,5,HP LaserJet Pro - M1136 Multifunction Laser Printer,"The HP printer landed in absolutely good condition well before the date declared at the time of ordering on Flipkart. This printer is just the right size, capacity and utility for a small office and can take a good amount of load even if the load is a bit more than recommended by the company. Print quality - outstanding HP class, uncomparable to any other brand in the market. Definitely a good buy."
10198,4,Excellent Choice,"This is excellent MF printer I came across. Worth buying it. However it is true just as mentioned in other posts that Flipkart is not offering competitive prices. But overall great product by HP. Only negative point that I can mention is about the scanner quality. Zeroxing is much better but when same document is scanned and printed, the quality is significantly compromised."
10199,4,Best printer you can get for 10k ...,Got my delivery within 3 days from FLIPKART ..... installing the printer was a piece of cake .... as usual print quality was awesome .. also note that this printer comes with a introductory cartridge which lets u print 700 pages .... yea !!! u heard it !!! 700 pages from an introductory HP Laserjet cartridge ... and the scan quality was pretty good though i wouldn't mind if the print resolution was a bit more than > 600 dpi .... nevertheless this is an awesome laser printer for around 10k .....
10200,4,good printer,at firs it was not able to install so I allowed windows update to install the driver software.this really worked.printing output is good.but problem is the cd related with it.if software is corrected.then it will be the best printer
10201,3,works with linux,"I have used this printer with Linux, hplip library from HP is available which works well with Ubuntu 12.10 onwards not tried with Fedora and other variants."
10202,5,good printer,good printer do not put cd avaible with the printer instead printer driver will be automaticallyjust go to control and see all devices your printer will also be listed
10203,4,Good quality product,nice product
10204,5,Great product,Very good specification
10205,5,Amazing Multi functional from HP at this prize,"I have bought this HP Laser Jet Pro M 1136 before few months for Home use only. Its is very good multi functional product by HP at this rate because i have spend 9500 INR for this.By cartige which is coming with this product, i am able to printout 750-800 pages.But when i refilled it, still today i have printed more than 1000 page eventhought cartige is not being empty. So its very cheap that for 250 INR (Cartige refilling charge) you can print 1000 pages."
10206,1,Don't waste your money,1 star to flipkart delivery service and 5 star to hp product
10207,5,Good printer,"Value for money.Never fails on you.Good printing quality and also very easy to use.I have been using this printer for more than a year and has never faced any problems with printing, scanning or copying.The cartridge had to be refilled only after a lot of use."
10208,3,Happy with the product but I don't believe I have been given a brand new one. Had lot of marks,"When I opened the package, firstly I found a broken piece of plastic. I was furious and started looking for the broken side or plastic, later realised that broken part is not mine rather has come from somewhere else in my box. But why that should be there? Box should contain only the items described and not some unnecessary items. Secondly, the printer had numerous scratches and few minor dents which are not acceptable for an item that I have purchased with that much amount."
10209,5,Just wow!,Very good printer and flipkart best price...
10210,1,Poor Quality!,The product is not as great as the specifications mentioned at flipkart.Go for a better Product and also Try to purchase it directly from HP if possible!!
10211,3,HP LaserJet Pro - M1136 Multifunction Laser Printer,Good Print quality.Poor Scanning.Poor Copy.Only a good price point.Will not recommend for Office Use.Good PackingOk for home use.
10212,1,Bad choice,"I got this printer thinking that this would help us print more cheaper, but the cartridge ran out printing some 300 text pages (with in first week) where as they claim it would print 750 pages. The HP support was really sad for new printer which cost Rs10,000/- They were not worried at all they said they cannot do any thing, the cartridge printed 300 pages and now i had to go and buy a new cartridge, This was their solution every time i contacted them and they were not even concern th..."

10218,5,Good as a Multi Functional Printer,I have purchased this printer for Home use and find it quite good till now. Scanner is is also quite good and Scan to Print work really well. Did not have any problems till now. Printing Quality is also good.
10219,4,"Printer Good, Not happy with Rs.90 charged for quick delivery","No complaints about the printer, its amazing..However, since I wanted it the next day I paid Rs.90 extra, but the printer was delivered 2 days after I placed the order. So, it was no use paying Rs.90 extra, since anyways flipkart delivers in 2-3 days if you opt for normal delivery."
10220,5,Great but not satisfied with cartridge!,"Okay!This is a great value for money.Looks very sleekFirst,I would say that it creates a problem for new user.You have to remove all those shipping tapes and that piece of thermocole which is quite difficult for a new user.Worst Point!They have provided an HP starter cartridge!Not a complete one!The real one 88a costs about 3.5k.So,I am dissatisfied with this!Rest it was a good printer!"

10233,4,very nice printer,"Very nice printer,it prints good. it prints more. it prints than 1000pages. I myself refilled the catridge. it is easy to refill the catridge"
10234,1,do not go,i bought this product through COD basis then only i came to know that HP dont have the software for this particular modal so i cancelled the product immediately flip kart re-payed my money.but before buying this product please check the software support from HP.
10235,1,Not recommended at all,"Flipkart is adeceitable website. they said that this product is on emi, but total amount of product has been debited at the time of purchase from my acount.."
10236,1,Worst experience ever!,"The invoice was provided for the later date by the seller. I tried to call the toll-free number and the seller's number from their website. None of these were useful. The delayed invoice led to financial loss for me as I couldn't get the reimbursement for the product from my office. I had to pay for the whole product from my own pocket.Very irresponsible seller indeed (Netsys Technology, Gurgaon)"
10237,5,Terrific purchase,I am very happy from buying this printer(-.-)
10238,5,Just wow!,"I received this priduct in 5 days from flipkart. Until now, Ihave used it only twice. In this short span of time i have got to know that it is a really impressive printer amd scanner. I got 2 years extended warranty and one year normal warranty. It means my printer is under warranty for next 3 years.At first my warranty date was incorrct. so i contacted hp and upon showing the bill hp customer care took 2 3 days to update the warranty date.That's it!!"
10239,3,dissapointed,although printer scanner functions well.....problem is with catridge ...took only 500 pages..then refill ...then refill then refilll....maintainance and refilling for just 4to 500 pages print sucks.....
10240,5,Best in the market!,I used this printer 2014 to till date still working good i taken 1 lack print above. One of the best printer all time.
10241,5,"very nice, multifunction laser printer","worth considering for home use..though somewhat bulky, but works fine... have been using for last two weeks, nice output, crisp printing, only A4 photo copier but quite satisfied with the product due to refillable cartridge."
10242,4,Nice product,"Writing this review after a month's usage.It's nice, the best thing about this is that you can easily make a xerox copy without the intervention of a PC.Very fast in printing.But The HP UI is not user friendly.Canon gives mp navigator which helps us to do alot of things easily but here even though the scanner n printer are better but the UI lacks proper design.Many third party drivers are available to overcome this problem but are paid version.A normal user cannot use this printer at it..."
10243,5,Awesome Printer by HP,I bought this printer 6 months ago and I will be honest that this is the one of the best printer so far I have seen.Pros:1. Best Laser Printer and gives very good print out.2. Gives good number of print out.3. Scanner is awsome and can be configured to get good pixel density scan.Cons:1. Black and White Printer.2. No Wifi support.I will not count this as Cons as it was mentioned in the specification but its pros are that good that you can ignore its cons.Shushank Shukla
10244,4,Decent Product,"1. Scanner is of good quality, though the software provided is a very basic one. It does not support fast scanning and needs manual intervention every time.2. Printer quality is good.3. Photo copy is also good."
10245,5,Terrific,"For home user this is a laser printer,affordable and hp has a good service. Installation is very easy,it comes with the cd . Printing qlty is good, scanning takes times ,but is of good qlty for home users. it comes with hp starter cartilage which gives aprox 700 prints on economy mode.overall its a good product,better then ink jet as no issue of ink drying, flipkart delivered before time and in a good packing."
10246,5,Awesome Printing Experience on both windows and Linux OS,"I brought this from a normal offer on Flipkart and It works fine.The basic test cartridge shipped along with the product had printed many pages than expected.The printing quality is fine and when I struck with some issues with printer ,I got a excellent customer care experience with HP Care support.Printing:5 StarScanning: 5 StarPhotoCopy: 5 Star.Working fine with windows(When I connected for first time,the printer got recognized automatically-Thanks to autoSetup by HP).In linux follow ..."
10247,4,Great printer within the price bracket.,The print seems incredible within the price bracket. Scanning is pretty good. however the copy feature seems ok a the copy comes with very dark ink and there does not seem to be a method to lighten so that the print comes a bit light in case of copy.In all a pretty good printer will adequate feature unless you really avoid refilling powdered toner..!! :P as during refilling it spills all over and while refilling you have to wear masks and proper gloves in order to protect yourself from tone...

10356,1,Hated it!,Hp company is rejected this product to replace......don't purchase...my experience is bad with hp...some parts r missing from my product but company rejected the replacement..so it is a worst company....don't purchase the hp product
10357,2,Not good,Your are providing printer that‚Äôs ok but provide at least refill packs it is not available even in there customer care that means ones u have used full cartridge your 20000 printer is scrap‚Ä¶. Strictly not recommended to those who are planning to buy it
10358,5,Awesome,The product is excellent but I got to change the Toner within 2 months from purchase and it was very difficult to raise a complaint for a Technician to come and check the printer as it was not printing properly. After the complaint was registered they provided with free toner replacement which was good.

10364,4,Pretty good,A good buy with convenience of a Printer copier and scanner along with an Inktank. Post initial setup Wireless connectivity is seamless but sometimes there are connectivity issues post it wake up from sleep mode. Prints are good with decent speed. Ink refill is very easy and convenient with almost no chance of spillage. The HP smart app can be improved to work faster and have separate option for manual duplex printing. Compared to competition More software features can be added for scanning t...
10365,3,Does the job,Very slow print speed specially when you print a pdf and if you are doing both side then it is going to take a lot of time. The seller has put a template in the image section where it says that 38./. Faster than previous hp models but my 8 years old hp J1000 inkjet is much faster than this. Note: The xerox speed is good and print quality is top notch.

One older laptop with Windows 7 needed lot of software download.The printer is compact n stores papers inside.Printing is easy. Draft option is helpful for saving ink. The ink cartridges that came along seems small capacity.Will need to watch for ink usage.The 5 stars for the features, form factor and ease of use."

11035,4,Really Nice,It's good and does its job. Very easy setup and WiFi connect works smooth. HP app is so good.. Option to send over email and print.And yes as many have reviewed it's an ink eater printer. You have to replace carteges after 15-20 pages

And if you want to buy this product it will be good but be sure that the ink used is only pG-47 and CL-57 that is specific for it.. and the cost of this ink cartridge is heigh .. it gives only 250 pages for black and white and aroun180-200 coloured. And the scanning speed is bit slow as compared to other canon printer. It is best for personal use only.

11313,5,Good for home use,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.What I got with this very neat looking printer -1. connecting cables2. color + black ink cartridges3. Driver cdUnlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.Cheers to Flipkart :)"
11314,5,Fabulous!,"I loved this oder . The delivery boy's behaviour was also good . Very good product, worth of money and i loved a feature that we can zerox,print and scan. In the last i want to say that very very very very good product.üëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªü•∞üòçüòò"
11315,4,Really Nice,"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print."
11316,4,Wonderful,For the price of 1999 its a good deal.The printing is very slow.The copy and scan function works fine (good speed).Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.
11317,5,Awesome,"Timely delivery. Print quality is excellent. Easy to install. Got it at the best price. As usual, happy with my shopping experience"
11318,1,Not recommended at all,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high..So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
11319,5,nice product,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
11320,5,Great product,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
11321,4,Worth the money,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details .The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes .Yes buying the ink will be expensive .Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
11322,5,Super!,Amazing printerBut cartridge is expansiveBut there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridgeJust purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridgeYou can see videos in youtube of cartridge refillBy this way you can save your money upto 95 %Once again product is amazingThanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
11323,5,Terrific purchase,"PROS:1. Available at cheap price.2. Decent for less amount of printing.3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.CONS:1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included.2. Print speed is too slow.3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.Suggestion:Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink!Happy Printing :)"
11324,5,efficient and good product.,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
11325,3,Terrible product,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing.But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..Btw its a good printer like hp1050
11326,4,Nice product,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good.Cartidge is costly.After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
11327,3,Fair,it works amazing with low cost printing quality is very nice . well product
11328,2,Decent Product,Pros:1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshootCons:1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time2. Makes lot of noise while printing.Verdict:You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...
11329,5,about printer,it is good and viry high compartiable product it can scan fast and it can print with a good print its good printer so many of them should by withs seller
11330,2,Funny cartridge is costly than printer :),This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning.scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.
11331,5,Good printer in Low Budget,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart."

11333,5,Simply awesome,This is the 2nd time I am buying this printer. This is a very good printer for ur home and not for heavy usage. I brought this printer again coz refilling of the catriges is very simple and can be done at home. I refilled my previous printer catriges almost 7-8 times. You can get many videos on utube on refilling Cannon pixma catriges. If u buy new cartriges it will cost u around Rs 600-700 for black and Rs 800-900 for colour. It's better if u refill the catriges at home every refilling will ...
11334,4,Delightful,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
11335,4,Delightful,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
11336,5,Worth every penny,Before time delivery and well packed. Very good printer for domestic use.. Good quality printing and scanning. Recommended product from my side in the price range.
11337,1,No value orientation,"Well despite the fact that its a good brand. The product is not worth buying.I bought it some 8 month back and believe me it has hardly given some good response and hardly got 30 copy printed.Such a Waste of money, instead get it xerox from store and get a good one."
11338,1,Unsatisfactory,"It's been a week since I bought the product and still haven't been successful in getting it connected to an android phone. Downloaded two apps and still not done. Such products should have longer duration for returns and should also have refund options.I still haven't managed. If there is anyone to support or guide, pls contact."
11339,4,Nice printer for price you pay,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
11340,4,Really Nice,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
11341,5,Must buy!,Packing is awsome ! Prints a bit slow but thats good enoght for that price ! Works fine
11342,3,Three Stars,Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects2. It is scanner + printer which both works fine.3. Doesn't take much space and sheetsCons :Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paperPaper takes too much time to get recieved in printerOverall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ

11346,5,Wonderful,"Excellent product in seal pack . Lowest price for an all in one . Good quality printing , scanning . Easy to handle for personal use"
11347,5,Excellent Product,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
11348,4,Value-for-money,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."
11349,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Great product for an average user, it's perfect for office or school work and the best thing it's color cartridges ain't much costly either."

11351,3,Does the job,printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.
11352,2,Better not to buy.,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy.Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day."
11353,3,Does the job,it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful
11354,5,Worth every penny,A very great printing is done by this awesome printer. Budget friendly as well as excellent performance is what I review.Must buy from Flipkart cuz of amazing price and fast delivery.
11355,2,Not good,"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-. Flipkart delivery boy insisted the ""home"" delivery in our area, we given the delivery address clearly at the time of booking with Pincode. After few argument, finally they delivered ""on the road"" nearer to the address given. I am not happy with the delivery, that is why 2 star rating given."

11376,2,Slightly disappointed,Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine
11377,5,Very good printer and decent price!!,"It is doing fairly good job in printing, scanning and copying. It comes very handy at home for children projects and small printing and photocopying tasks.One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION. Printer interface is guiding how to change paper for printing on second side of the paper. I took printout on both sides of paper through MS word and PDF files. I am much satisfied with its performance."
11378,3,Nice,This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly
11379,4,Wonderful,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
11380,5,Just wow!,"I got this for office work, prints and photo prints at home. Its amazingly user friendly i installed this and use it with laptop. Best part is they hv given both ink cartridges with this. I had A4 size paper with me. Only prob is it doesn't connects with any mobiles as USB point is for laptop or pc. I had to watch YouTube videos though as manual is bakwaas n cd dekhne ka tym nahi hai. But really excellent print outs n fast."
11381,5,Great AIO from Canon in low budget.,"In this budget, it gives great service. I have bought it specially for scanning purpose. It gives good scanned images as well as scanned pdf documents. Its printing quality is also good."
11382,4,Working perfectly as told and best in price,purchased this product a few days back. Recieved on time and it is working perfectly and value for money. the best all in one printer at affordable price. As i know it is the only printer with multi-functions and at such low cost in the market right now. So guys go for it.

Works fine till now.The product is shipped with two partially filled cartridges- color and black which is the best thing because once your cartridges are finished you need around 2000 rs to buy new pair of cartridges. Refilling is also an option and work up to around 10 times on black but clarity will be on the downside.The main disadvantage is the ink consumption. Each time printer...

Though the company promised that it will has normal speed, it is printing with excellent speed and quality. Very quality product from Canon and thanks for flipkart for this product and quick delivery."
11403,3,Good one at this price!,"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon.Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge.What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised.Another issue is that it doesn'..."

11405,4,8 out of 10,"Excellent delivery by Flipkart. I got the printer by 2 days of ordered.Basically about this printer , I just say a good deal for home use purpose. It's quality of printing is OK but takes lil more ink than usual...Overall I am quite happy with it.."
11406,5,nice product,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
11407,4,Value For Money,"It a good product. For the specification and options it has it actually good deal. Though I experienced little problem, service was quick and friendly so I find it value for money."
11408,1,Not recommended at all,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high..So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
11409,5,nice product,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
11410,5,Great product,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
11411,4,Worth the money,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details .The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes .Yes buying the ink will be expensive .Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
11412,5,Super!,Amazing printerBut cartridge is expansiveBut there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridgeJust purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridgeYou can see videos in youtube of cartridge refillBy this way you can save your money upto 95 %Once again product is amazingThanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
11413,5,Terrific purchase,"PROS:1. Available at cheap price.2. Decent for less amount of printing.3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.CONS:1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included.2. Print speed is too slow.3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.Suggestion:Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink!Happy Printing :)"
11414,5,efficient and good product.,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
11415,3,Terrible product,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing.But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..Btw its a good printer like hp1050
11416,4,Nice product,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good.Cartidge is costly.After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
11417,3,Fair,it works amazing with low cost printing quality is very nice . well product
11418,5,Perfect product!,Thank you omniretail and flipkart for such offer and express delivery...One thing is that once you setup by using YouTube videos Rest no need to do anything just turn on printer and send command it will do its job ...
